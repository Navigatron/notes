### Toast and Eggs

#### Shit you'll need

##### Equipment

- Sauce pan / Frying pan, size of your hand ish.
- Metal spatula
- plate+fork, bowl+fork, something to eat it with.

##### Food

- Bread
	- Carbohydrates are great.
- Eggs
	- like 3 bucks for 2 dozen.
- Butter
	- so much butter.

#### Sequence of Events

##### Toast

1. make that pan HOT.
2. drop in 1/2 dollop of butter.
	- watch it melt
3. Drop in that bread
	- It'll soak up the butter, don't worry if the pan looks dry.
	- The dry part is what makes it toasty.
4. This is the secret - *Press down on the bread*.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each side of each piece.
	- I usually make 2 pieces.
	- Yes, it's a lot of butter.

##### Eggs

I usually make two at once in the same pan.

1. make the pan a little less hot?
	- still hot, but not toasting hot.
2. Add Butter. Full dollop this time.
	- I forgot to do this one time and those eggs weren't pretty.
		- still tasty tho
3. Crack the eggs directly into the pan
	- Heck outta here middle school FCS teacher with your pastry dish shenanigans
	- Aight ACT FAST YOU GOT LIKE 30 SECONDS
4. Seasoning! Salt and Pepper!
	- I'm poor
	- It's tasty
5. Once the bottom layer is white, edges a little fried, and it looks like a propper egg, flip it.
	- Idk how to do this. Just wing it.
6. Cook em' for ~12 seconds on the second side
7. take the pan off the heat before you eat. Maybe put some water on it so it's easier to clean.
