# Probability and Statistics I & II

So this section of notes is really a mess.

I take my notes for these classes on paper, so it takes a lot of extra effort to transcribe
to MathJax and individual topics for web publishing.

Maybe I'll get around to it, maybe I wont.

For here, WYSIWYG - what you see is what you get.

## Prob and Stats One

[Groundwork and Discrete Probability](./notes-ps1/intro.md)

```
Haven't written these yet

[Discrete Probability Distributions](./I/discrete_distros.md)

[Continuous Probability and Distributions](./I/continuous.md)

[Linear Combinations, Samples, Confidence Intervals](./I/end.md)
```
## Prob and Stats Two

[AUG 30 - Definitions and Point Estimation](./notes/AUG30.md)

[TODO - SEP 04 - Which Estimator to Use, Properties of Uniform Distribution](./notes/SEP04.md)
