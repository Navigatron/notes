# Probability and Statistics I & II

I take/took my notes for these classes on paper. Getting them online is more work than
for other classes.

Expect infrequent updates. What you see is what you get.

## Prob and Stats Two

I've decided to organize the notes for this class by topic rather than by date.

- Point Estimation
    - principles (Click AUG30 below)
    - Proving Unbiasedness (Also under AUG30 below)
    - Which Estimator to Use (Lowest Variance)
    - Creating Estimators ()
        - Method of Moments (MoM)
            - [principles](./notes/method_of_moments/principles.md)
            - [example - exponential distro](./notes/method_of_moments/ex_exponential.md)
        - Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE)
            - [principles]



## Misc

This is the leftovers from a poor attempt at organization by date.
