# Creating Point Estimators - Method of Moments

A moment is ... a measure of ... the shape? of a function?

Populations have moments, Samples have moments, and these moments relate to each other.

$K$th population moment = $\mu _ k$ = $E(X^k)$

$\mu _ 1$ = $E(X^1)$ = population mean

$K$th sample moment = $m _ k$ = $\frac 1 n \Sum _ {i=0} ^n (x_i^k)$

$m_1$ = $\frac 1 n \sum (x_i)$ = $\bar x
