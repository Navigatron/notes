#### Tiers:
1. Molecules
2. Organnelles
3. Cells
4. Tissue
5. Organs
6. Organ Systems
7. Organism (Today we are a fish)
8. Population
    - One Species
    - One Defined Area
9. Communities
    - All the living things in an area
    - in this classroom, us, flies, ants, etc.

    - Abiotic Things
        - Chairs
        - Weather
11. Biosphere

#### Science!
- Inductive Reasoning
    - Observations
    - Draw Conclusions
- Deductive Reasoning
    - Hypothesis
    - Trying to Explain Why

##### What is a Theory?
- Backed by Lots of Data
- Composed of Lots of hypothesis

##### The Scientific Method
1. Observation
2. Form a Testable Hypothesis
3. Experiment with Controlled Variables
4. Form a Conclusion, affirming or rejecting the hypothesis.
