whelp, slides changed quickly. There's something due tomorrow though.

# Biological Macro-molecules

## Introduction

Lactose (ose=sugar) intolerance - lacking lactase (ase=enzyme)

Most of the world's population cannot digest milk-based food.

Those that can handle lactose are the mutants.

We tend to stop producing enzymes we don't need - if you drink milk on the daily, you'll
probably be able to continue. If you stop, you'll probably have to stop forever.

## Chapter Goals

- Know properties of each of the four groups of bio-macro-molecules
- Recognize basic structures
- Know constituent monomers for each type of polymer

## Four groups

1. Proteins
2. Nucleic Acids (DNA, RNA, ATP)
3. Carbohydrates
4. Lipids

## Carbon - It's heckin' everywhere

- Likes to bond to 4 things, like a tetrahedron.
- Carbon rings, hydrogen everywhere also.

```
Ethanol: (Grain Alcohol)

       H   H
       |   |
   H - C - C - O - H
       |   |
       H   H

```

## Important Chemical Groups

- Hydroxyl Group `-OH`
- Carbonyl Group `--C=O` (Two single bonds off carbon)

```
Carboxyl Group

      O
    //
 - C
    \
     OH
```

### Amino Acids

`NH_2` or `N^+H_3`

## Build a Tree

- Biochem
	- Gets energy from Carbohydrates
		- Such as Sugars
		- and Starches
		- or Cellulose for Grazing animals
	- Stores energy in Lipids
		- Fats and Oils
		- Also used to make cell membranes
		- Saturated Fats in Animals
		- Unsaturated fats in plants
	- Builds cells with Proteins
		- And the slide changed, couldn't get it all.
	- Build genetic code with Nucleic Acids

The above tree was copied from the slides in class. Point of the slide was to tell us to make our own tree.

## How to make/break Macro-Molecules

### Dehydration Reactions
*Be of Remove Water*

Polymers, Monomers. Take away the water and the other things stick together. Now there's just a polymer (and excess water), and it's longer than before.

```

   - O - H   H - O -

Becomes

   - O - and H-O-H

```

Glucose + Glucose = Maltose + Water

### Hydrolysis Reactions
*Using water to break polymers.*

If we're breaking polar things, cool. Otherwise we'll need help.

Drop some water onto a long polymer and it'll break up, also release some energy.

Remember NaCL? That was easy to break.

## Carbohydrates

### Simple Sugars - *GOTTA GO FAST*

- Fruit, plain sugar, candy, orange juice
- Monosacharides (One Sugar)
- Glucose (The Simplest)
- Ribose (Part of DNA)
- Sucrose (Table Sugar)
- Lactose (Dairy)
- Fructose (Fruit, Cola)
- polar Carbon Chain
- 3 to 7 (ish) carbons, some Hydrogen, some Oxygen.
- Disacharides
	- See dehydration reactions above
- Average american eats 130 pounds of *added* sugar annually.

### Complex Carbohydrates - **S l o w   b u r n**

- Bread, Pasta
- Starch = Polysacharide (Many sugars)
	- Used by plants to store energy
	- Tasty af
- Glycogen
	- Stored in our livers
	- Composed of Glucose monomers
	- Lots of endpoints to rip apart
		- Quick energy access
- Cellulose
	- Structural, cell walls of plants
	- We're really bad at eating this
		- But we do anyway, we use it as *Fiber*.
		- Internal Scrub-Brush
		- Doesn't break down
		- Scrubs waste through
		- Without it, nutrient absorption suffers.
- Chitin (Ki-Tin)
	- Builds exoskeleton of insects and crustaceans
	- We can eat shrimp / lobster shells. I guess.
	- You could also eat crickets... if you wanted to?

## Splenda

- Labeled as "Made from Sugar"
	- True
- tastes 600x sweeter than sugar
- Take Glucose
	- Remove 3 OH
	- Add chlorine instead
	- Shape stays the same
		- Still detected as sugar
	- Isn't metabolized, zero calories.
		- Because it's chlorine.
			- It's terrible for you.

# Lipids
*Look at this Fatcat*

![](http://cdn.funnyand.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Fat-Cat-760x500.jpg)

Used for:
- Energy Storage
- Cell Structures
	- Cell membranes
- Base of some hormones, vitamins
- Capture light in photosynthesis
- Thermal insulation
- *Nerve Impulse Conduction*
	- This is important

Made by:

- Take a Glycerol
- Take a CH_2 chain (ends with a CH_3)
- Dehydration Reaction
- Forms a straight line
	- Straight lines like to pack together tightly

And then:

- Fatty Acids 1, 2, and 3, all join onto a single glycerol.
- This becomes a saturated fatty acid.
	- This'll clog your arteries.

- saturated
	- Saturated with Hydrogen
	- Straight line.
	- Pack Hella Tight.
	- Solid at room temp
- Unsaturated
	- Missing one or more hydrogen
		- replaced with double bonds
	- Typically liquid at room temp.
	- Mono
		- Single bend, pack loosely
	- Poly
		- Tangle with each other.

Vegetable Oil + Hydrogen = Crisco. *Hydrogenated*.

## Phospholipids

- Two fatty acid tails
	- One of them is unsaturated
	- Hyrophobic
- Phosphate group
	- Hydrophilic
- Create barriers for cell membranes
	- "Lipid Bilayer"

![](http://www.assignmentpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lipid-Bilayer.jpg)

## Steroids

- 4 carbon rings
	- 3 6-rings, 1 5-ring
- Add a carbon chain, get Cholesterol.
- Add a different carbon chain, get Vitamin D.
- Testosterone
- Cortisol
- These are also important things.

# Protiens aka Polypoptides
*We're going through a lot today.*

- Poly = Many
- Peptide = Bond between amino acids

We are based in 20 amino acids.

Proteins are used all over the places. We make 10k+ different flavors on the daily.

## Amino Acid Structures

- Central Carbon with 4 things on it
	1. Hydrogen
	2. Amino Group
	3. Carboxyl Group
	4. 'R' group, or functional group. This does the work.

Then we get big chains of amino acids.

- Primary Structure
	- Just one amino acid structure
- Secondary Structure
	- oh no, class is ending
- There's also a 3rd level and 4th level

## Denatured Proteins

- We'll get there next class I hope
