# Eukaryotic Cell Division

1. Duplicate Chromosomes -> Sister chromatids
2. Separate Chromatids and other organelles
3. Split into two daughter cells

word | def
---|---
Chromatin | protein DNA wraps around
Chromatids | X of duplicate chromosomes
chromosomes | wdyt
Homologous Chromosomes | They are the same
Centromere | The thing that holds the chromatids together, in the center of the X

# Mitosis Phases

- Interphase
	- (G1) Growth - actually
	- (S) DNA synthesis
	- (G2) Growth - duplicate organelles
- Miotic phase
	- Prophase - Chromatin Condenses
	- Prometaphase - Spindle fibers attach to centromeres, nucleus break down
	- Metaphase - replicated chromosomes align in middle
	- Anaphase - Spindle fibers pull sister chromatids apart
	- Telophase - Two nuclei form
	- cytokinesis - cell splits in two

# ?

Humans are Diploid, or 2N - one chromosome from dad, one from mom. Two.

DNA replication duplicates each chromosome, creating sister chromatids

# Meiosis

There's some talk of this.
