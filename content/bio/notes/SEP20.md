# Chapter 5 - Plasma Membrane
*A sea of lipids, peppered with proteins, coated with sugars*

We'll be looking at cell membrane structure, cellular respiration, and enzyme functions.

## Membrane Functions

- Barrier formation
    - Separate the cell from the environment
- Regulation
- Communication
    - plasmodesmada in plants

## Membrane composition
- phospholipid bilayer
- embedded and attached proteins
- "fluid mosaic"
- And one other thing but the slide changed.

Many phospholipids are unsaturated, meaning kinks, meaning they don't pack together well. Cholesterol acts as a regulator, keeping membranes stable when hot and flexible when cold.

> It maintains the Squishy Level

## Membrane Proteins

- Maintain cell shape
- coordinate changes inside and outside
- cell-cell recognition
- attach cells to each other
- selective permeability
    - some substances cross easier than others
- among other things

### channel transport proteins
- passive
    - go with concentration gradient
    - "facilitated Diffusion"
- active
    - require ATP
    - against concentration gradient

## Passive Diffusion

Small hydrophobic molecules can scoot on through the membrane.

## Osmosis

Osmosis is specifically water, moving through specifically a selectively permeable membrane.

## Tonicity

- The ability of a solution to cause a cell to gain or lose water.
- isotonic
    - Equal inside and outside the cell.
- hypotonic
    - Not enough solute
    - Adds water, extracts solute
- hypertonic
    - Lots of solute
    - Extracts water

## Osmoregulation

- How an organism deals with tonicity.
- aqua pour-in
    - large protein
    - bulk-move water

## Moving bigger things

- Exocytosis
    - Exo = Out
- Endocytosis
    - Endo = In
    - Phagocytosis
        - "Cell Eating"
        - Wrap membrane around target, bring in.
    - Pinocytosis
        - "Cell Drinking"
        - Bringing in large amounts of water at once.
        - also brings in dissolved solutes
    - Receptor-mediated endocytosis
        - Membrane wrapping has receptor proteins
