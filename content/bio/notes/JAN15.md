## Chapter 20 - Unifying Concepts of Animal Structure and Function

"Supplemental Handout" (worksheet) has been acquired. We'll get them all the time.
They're not collected or graded.

### Structure and Function of Animal Tissues

Anatomy - Study of Structures - *Form*

Physiology - How structures work as a whole - *Function*

- Electrical, Chemical Processes
- Organs and Organ Systems

*Anatomy Affects Physiology*

- Levels of Organization
    - Tissues
        - An integrated group of similar cells that perform a common function
    - Organs
        - Perform a specific task, made of 2+ tissues
    - Organ Systems
        - Multiple organs that together perform a task.

#### Epithelial Tissue

- Sheets of closely packed cells
- Layers
- 3 types of layering systems
    - Simple: It's just a layer bro.
    - Stratified: A bunch of layers. (Like Skin)
    - Pseudostratified: 1 Layer, but all the cells are different sizes.
- Shape of cells
    - Squamous: Like a fried egg
    - Cuboidal: cube-ish, all similar shape/size
    - Columnar: Column, rect from side, like the hot glue rods in the box)

#### Connective Tissue

> "I think this is the hardest tissue group to define" - Prof.

> "Support and Connection of other tissues. It's the most common type, so if
you don't know what you're looking at, It's probably connective"

Tune in next time for... more tissues?
