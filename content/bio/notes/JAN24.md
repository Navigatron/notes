## Chapter 22

> Gas exchange and Mammalian respiratory system in [last classes notes.](./JAN22.md)

### Transportation of Gasses in the Human Body

- Gasses move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration
    - Tissues have hella CO2
    - Blood has some CO2
    - Air has very little CO2 (relative to internally)
    - CO2 moves: Tissues -> Blood -> Air
    - O2 moves: Air -> Blood -> Tissues
- Hemoglobin carry O2
    - polypeptide chain (protein)
    - contains multiple (4) "Heme Groups"
    - each of which contain an iron atom, which holds the O2
    - There are ~250 million Hemoglobin per red blood cell
- CO2 transport
    - CO2 enters red blood cells
    - Some CO2 combines with hemoglobin
    - Other CO2 + water becomes carbonic acid, which becomes Hydrogen ions and Bicarbonate ions
    - Nervous system monitors carbonic acid concentration, too much = breath
    - Hemoglobin binds to H+, minimizing blood pH change
- Human Fetus Gas Exchange
    - Capillaries in the placenta run next to each other
        - Exchange gasses, do not mix
    - Fetal hemoglobin attracts O2 more strongly than adult hemoglobin
    - Smoking during pregnancy decreases fetal O2 supply by 25%
    - At birth, CO2 increases, triggering breathing.

### Chapter 22 Summary

- Three phases of gas exchange
    - Ventilation
    - Gas Exchange
    - Cellular Respiration
- Gas exchange surfaces
    - Direct exchange
    - Tracheal system
    - gills
    - Lungs + surfactants

Be able to:

- Describe impacts of smoking
- Explain how breathing is controlled
- Describe hemoglobin
- Describe fetal gas exchange

## Chapter 23

- Circulatory Systems
- The Human Cardiovascular System and Heart
- Structure and Function of blood vessels
- Blood

### Circulatory Systems

> "Ultimate Facilitator"

- Transports O2 in and CO2 out
- Transports nutrients from digestive system
- Transports waste to be filtered out by kidneys
- Transports hormones and other signalers, like adrenaline

- Evolution of Circulation
    - Super tiny things can diffuse directly with the environment
    - Medium things (such as flatworms)
        - Gastrovascular cavity, incomplete gut system
        - puts the nutrients as close as they need to get
        - still relies heavily on diffusion
    - Big Things
        - Muscular Pump
        - Circulatory Fluid
        - Vessels to carry the fluid
- Types of Circulation
    - Open Systems
        - Found in arthropods and most mollusks
        - The heart is a big tube, with defined start and end
        - Blood is pumped directly into the body cavity, diffuses back into the heart
        - This is a little complicated, here's an image
        - ![](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/open_circulatory_system.jpg)
    - Closed Systems
        - continuous loop, no start or end
        - blood stays in vessels
- Names for the vessels
    - Arteries
        - carry blood away from the heart
        - **A**rteries, **a** for **a**way. **&nbsp;**
        - Most carry oxygenated blood, some do not
        - break down into arterioles
    - Capillaries
        - Tiny, perform exchange with tissues
    - Veins
        - Return blood to the heart
        - Most carry de-oxygenated
- Evolution of Heart Structure
    - Fish
        - Two chambers
        - Atrium
            - receives blood from veins
        - Ventricle
            - Pumps blood out
        - "Single Circuit" system
            - There's only one loop.
    - Amphibians and Reptiles
        - Two Atriums, one ventricle
        - Blood from body into one atrium, lungs to the other
        - But the bloods mix in the single ventricle
    - Land and Avian Vertebrates
        - Barrier splits the ventricle in two
        - 4-chambered heart
        - Double Circulation
        - Blood goes through the heart twice
        - Like two race tracks instead of one
        - Pulmonary Circuit
            - Direct line to gas exchange
        - Systemic Circuit
            - Powers everything else

> On Thursday, we'll start with the Human Cardiovascular System.
