# Biology II Lecture, March 19th

## Housekeeping

- Exam 3: 2 weeks from today

## Chapter 31 (Continued)

- Plant Structure and Function was covered last class
- Plant Growth
- Reproduction of Flowering Plants

### Plant Growth

Determinate growth vs indeterminate growth

- Determinate
	- Stopping at a certain point - animals mostly
- Indeterminate
	- Continues growing throughout lifespan - plants, mostly

Plants are categorized by lifespan

- Annuals
	- Live cycle = 1 year
- Biennials
	- Life cycle = 2 years
- Perennials
	- Live for many years

> Notecard 1: Organs in the shoot system of the plant

Primary Growth makes plants longer

- Meristems
	- Specialized tissue
	- undifferentiated cells
	- when conditions are favorable, they divide
- Apical meristems
	- Meristems at the tips of roots and buds of shoots
- Primary Growth
	- Occurs at the apical meristems
	- Roots push down into the soil
	- Shoots grow upwards, for more sunlight and surface area for gas exchange.

Secondary Growth increases the diameter of woody plants

- Secondary Growth
	- Increase thickness of stems and roots
	- Occurs at lateral meristems
- Lateral meristems
	- Areas of active cell division that exist in two cylinders that extend along the length of roots and shoots.
	- Vascular cambium
		- Lateral meristem that lies between primary xylem and primary phloem
		- solely responsible for secondary growth
	- Cork cambium
		- lateral meristem that lies at the outer edge of the stem cortex
		- Bark on a tree

"Vascular cambium gives rise to new tissues"

- vascular cambium
	- produces cells in two directions - xylem and phloem.
	- It's like a ring in a tree, and it makes more rings both inside and outside itself.
- Cork cambium
	- produces cells outwards, bark
	- like the outermost ring of a tree, pushing new cells out

The rings, what do they mean?

- Growth Rings in Trees
	- Growth of secondary xylem stops in the wintertime
	- rings occur when new growth starts each year
- Bark, (secondary phloem and cork) erodes overtime.


Back to Secondary growth

- Wood rays
	- parenchyma cells
	- transport water and nutrients
	- store organic nutrients
	- aid in wound repair
- sapwood
	- near the vascular cambium
	- transports xylem fluid (sap)
- heartwood
	- Older layers of secondary xylem
	- no longer transport water
	- store resins and waste

### Reproduction of Flowering Plants

> Notecard 3: Is the flower shown a monocot or dicot?

Flowers contain four types of modified leaves

- sepals
	- lower, outermost part of flower
	- typically green
	- enclose/protect flower bud
- petals
	- colorful, fragrant
	- advertising to pollinators

The last two are Stamens and Carpels

Male Reproductive Anatomy

- stamens are made of two parts
	- anther
		- On top of filament
		- pollen produced here
	- filament
		- supporting stalk, holds up anther

Female Reproductive Anatomy

- Carpels
	- style
		- "long slender neck"
		- recieves, transports pollen
	- stigma
		- tip of the style
		- sticky, collects pollen
	- ovary
		- contains one or more ovules
		- each ovule contains a developing egg and supporting cells

"Pistil" can refer to one Carpel or a group of fused Carpels

Life-Cycle of an angiosperm

1. Mature plant with flowers is fertilized
2. Flower develops into a fruit+seed
3. Fruit is eaten, falls, somehow travels.
4. Seed germinates
5. Seed becomes a seedling
6. Seed grows into a mature plant

Basic seed anatomy

- endosperm (high starch)
- one or two cotyledons
- a root (radicle)
- a shoot (plumule)
- A tough seed coat

> Not the best picture but it's what I could find quickly

the Embryo portion in the figure above contains:

- Cotyledon
- Embryonic leaf
- Embryonic shoot
- Embryonic root

Seed Dormancy

Growth and development are paused temporarily. This allows plants time to distribute their seeds. When the time is right, the seed will resume and become a plant.

Types of Fruits

- Fleshy
	- Wall of ovary softens when ripe
	- apples, oranges, grapes
- Dry
	- wind-dispersed fruits from grasses and such
	- beans, nuts, grains

Interesting things

- some fruits act like propellors
- coconuts use mainly water transport.
<!-- They yeet around the ocean -->

Germination

- seeds take up water
- embryonic root extends into soil
- up they go

> In space, plants get a little confused - until they find their light source. Once they have a light source, they figure out up and down pretty quickly.



> Notecard 4: give an example, other than the "runner" of a strawberry plant, that allows plants to reproduce asexually.



> Notecard 5: Name the book the image is from. (Shel Silverstein: The Giving Tree)
