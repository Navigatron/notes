# Mitosis vs Meiosis

## Review

Homologous Chromosomes are the pair from mom + dad.

Sister chromatids are duplicates of a single chromosome

Genes have information for traits - Chromosomes contain genes.

Mitosis splits a cell into two identical cells.

Meiosis creates sex cells - 50% chromosomes, all different, 4 in total.

Mitosis is for growth, repair, etc. Bacteria use it for asexual reproduction.

Corssing-Over or Recombination creates genetic variation

# What could possibly go wrong?

## Non-Disjunction

- Failure of Chromosomes or chromatids to separate normally during meiosis.
- meiosis I - Both of a pair go to one pole
- meiosis II - Ah, slide changed. Take your best guess.

# polyploid

Plants love this. When an organism has more than 2 sets of chromosomes,
it can create a brand new species.

# Gotta replicate that DNA

viva la DNA replication bubbles.

RNA is like DNA, but less.
