            - Leukocytes - White blood cells (Leukemia?)
            - Platelets - Help with clotting
        - Plasma
        - Why do we need this again?
- Muscle Tissue
    - Most abundant, it's all over.
    - Looong cells, contract/release
    - move shit
    - Smooth
        - Digestive tract, veins, arteries
        - smooth
    - Skeletal
        - Striated, Stringy, bacon looking
        - Multiple nuclei per cell
        - Voluntary control - brain does this.
    - Cardiac
        - The only muscle type in the heart
        - Striations / layers
        - 1 to 2 nuclei per cell
        - "Intercollated Discs" - faint lines divide on cell from another
        - Involuntary
- Nervous tissue
    - Communication network
    - Sense stimuli and rapidly transmit information
    - Highest concentrations in brain and spinal cord
    - Neuron
        - Generate and Transmit electro-chemical signals
    - Glia (Neuroglia)
        - Supporting functions for Neurons
        - Keep the electrochem near the neuron

## ~~Ogres~~ Organs

Example: the small intestine

![](https://media.istockphoto.com/vectors/microvilli-detail-of-the-small-intestine-vector-diagram-vector-id499566195)

- Epithelial
    - Smooth inner lining for absorption
- Connective
    - Blood vessels for transport
- Muscle
    - Contract, move the food

## ~~Ogre Communities~~ Organ Systems

There are ~12 organ systems in mammals. Each:

- Consists of many Organs
- Has one or more functions
- Works with other systems

Big bullet points:

- Integumentary system
    - Hair, skin, nails
    - Protects from:
        - Physical injury
        - infection
        - temperature extremes
        - Drying out
- Mr. Skeltal (doot doot)
    - Supports the body
    - Protects organs (ribcage, pelvis, skull)
    - Framework for muscle movement
- Muscular System
    - Moves things around
    - Maintains posture
    - Produces heat
- Circulatory System
    - Delivers O2 and nutrients from the source to everywhere else
    - Transport CO2 to the lungs
    - Transport metabolic waste to the kidneys
- Respiratory System
    - Exchange gasses with the environment
    - O2 in, CO2 out
- Urinary System
    - Remove waste from the blood
    - Excrete Urine
    - Regulate pH, chemical makeup, water balance of blood.
- Digestive System
    - Ingest, Digest, Absorb food
    - remove excess
- Endocrine System
    - Secretes hormones that regulate body activites
- Lymphatic and Immune systems
    - Protect from infection and cancer
    - Re-distribute excess fluid
- Nervous System
    - Made of nerves, neurons, neuroglia
    - Brain and spinal cords
    - Detects stimuli
    - Integrates information
    - Directs responses
    - Sensory organs
        - Special
            - eyes
        - General
            - Heat, body position
- Reproductive System
    - hormones play a large part here
    - Gammates
    - Production of offspring
    - Female system comes with components to sustain embryo and offspring

## Skin

- Epidermis (Epi=Above)
    - Epithelial Tissue
    - *Stratified Squamous* - Many layers, cells in fried-egg shape.
    - Rapid cell division
    - Protections
        - melanin for UV protection
        - Microbial penetration
        - Water loss (via oil)
- Dermis
    - Thickest layer
    - "Where the Magic Happens" - prof
    - Dense connective tissue
    - Hair production, Oil and sweat production, nerves, blood vessels
    - Produces vitamin D
    - Helps regulate temperature
    - Hair
        - Temp control
        - Made of a shaft of keratin-filled dead cells
    - Oil
        - inhibits bacterial growth
        - Conditions surrounding skin
        - Lubricates hair
- Hypodermis (Hypo=Below)
    - I guess we don't need to know much about this huh
- UV exposure
    - ages the skin, damages DNA, causes cancer
    - causes skin to release melanin, causes tan

## Internal External exchange

- We, as organisms, are "Open Systems"
    - Exchanging things with the environment
    - Internal organs can (and often are) closed systems
- Cells in small/flat things exchange directly
- We big things:
    - Too little surface area for the deepest inner cells to exchange
    - We use lungs and villi and such to increase exchange ability
    - circulatory system to move it where it needs to go
- Homeostasis
    - We do all this exchanging, yet need to maintain an internal environment
    - Negative feedback loops:
        - As something happens, it triggers a response to counteract it.
        - Heat triggers sweat which cools
        - Cold triggers shivering which warms

# End

> In the 1700s, in the Pennsylvania dutch region, younger children would follow
the butcher whenever he would butcher a hog. Afterwards, the butcher would give
the children the hog's bladder. Due to it's resilient, elastic nature, it could
be blown up like a balloon and kicked around.
