# Bio II, FEB14 - Chapter 24 part 2

## Housekeeping

- HWs due Sunday
- Project part II due eventually

## Adaptive Immune Response

- Antigens
    - An evil thing that made it past the innate immunity
- Antibodies
    - Shaped like a Y
    - Constant Region, attached to leukocyte
    - Variable Region, Binds to the Antigen
    - Shape of Variable region is specific to an antigen
        - This makes the "memory"
- Adaptive Immunity
    - obtained through natural exposure to antigen
    - Or, artificially by vaccination.
        - Dead antigen
        - "Modified Live" - edited to be harmless
        - Vaccines have prevented a lot of diseases
- The Lymphatic System
    - Returns fluid from tissues back to circulatory system
    - Helps fight infection
    - Organs and vessels all throughout the body
    - Capture / pick up bad things, carry to organs, lymphocytes attack
- Lymphocytes
    - B cells
        - "Humoral Immune Response"
        - Defends against bacteria and viruses present in body fluids
        - secrete antibodies into blood and lymph
    - T cells
        - "cell-mediated immune response"
        - Attack cells infected with bacteria or viruses
        - Promote phagocytosis by other WBCs
        - Stimulate B-cells to produce antibodies
- Antigen Receptors
    - Antigen Determinants, areas that uniquely identify an antigen
        - Antibodies bind here
    - "Antigen Binding Site"
        - Where things attach, lock + key style
- Clonal Selection
    - There are a lot of B cells hanging out
    - Each one has different antigen receptors
    - When an antigen comes along, it binds to the best fitting one
    - This triggers the B cell to duplicate, a lot
    - Some of the new B cells continue to hang out - this forms "memory"
    - The rest are "active", they start producing large quantities of antibodies
- Primary Response vs Secondary
    - First exposure vs later exposures
    - second exposure, body is ready, response is stronger and faster.
- Helper T cell activation
    - Microphage eats a microbe with antigens
    - Antigens bind to "self proteins" inside the microphage
    - Self proteins move to outside of cell
    - Helper T cell detects self proteins, binds, starts signaling
    - Signals tell B cells to produce antibodies
    - Signals attract Cytotoxic T cells
    - Cytotoxic T cell binds, injects Perforin
    - Perforin causes apoptosis, infected cell dies.

## Immune System Disorders

- Autoimmune
    - Immune system attacks itself or the body
- Immunodeficient
    - Immune system underactive, does not respond enough
- Allergies
    - Hypersensitivity to something otherwise harmless
    - Food
        - shellfish, peanuts
    - Environmental
        - Bees, poison Ivy
- Treatment
    - Light
        - Antihistamines
    - Severe
        - Treat for anaphylaxis, epinephrine, hospitalization
