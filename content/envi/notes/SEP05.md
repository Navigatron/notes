## Cognitive Dissonance

*How to deal with conflicting ideas*

- minimize risk to rationalize decision
    - Take an action despite better judgment

#### "Oh God Moment"

1. new evidence
2. evidence doesn't fit model
3. evidence rejected
4. repeat 1->3
5. Too much evidence to reject
6. evidence collectively forms new model.

## Anthropocene

*The time in which we live is a new geological epic.*

We're changing the earth enough that **we** are noticing it, now.

Future geologists will see this time period as a unique stripe.

### Nitrogen - we do a lot of that.

A long time ago, sea level stopped moving. Communities could form long term on the coast. Bam, worldwide agriculture.

After WWII, we invented fertilizer other than animal feces. Fertilized plants fix more nitrogen than all of everything else.

Nitrogen is a component of Proteins. It's essential for us to exist. We eat it in plants. plants get it from soil. Soil gets it from nitrogen-fixing bacteria on the roots of legumes.

### Why are humans the problem

#### The issues
- Rapid population growth
    - there are a lot of us
- Rapid / wasteful use of resources
    - We use a lot of resources
        - 40% of food we buy is thrown out
        - power shower hour
- degradation of earth's life-support systems
    - Ozone layer blocks UV light
    - Nitrogen cycle disruption
    - Ice Caps / temp regulation

#### Why do we do this - Professor
- Focus on short-term gain
    - future rewards weighted less important due to time
        - Built-in human fallacy
- Failure of 'economic and political systems' to encourage earth-sustaining forms of economic development
    - "The government's not telling us to stop"
    - aka we didn't make a gov that tells us to stop.
    - See below on neo-liberal economic thought
    - neither Capitalism nor Communism preserve the env all that well
        - USSR grew cotton, dried up the Aral Sea.
- Economic Systems do not factor environmental impact into market price
    - Externalities - things involved in a trade not factored into price.
        - Public education gives us more benefit than cost
        - Gasoline doesn't factor in the environmental cost
            - With production impacts, $11/gallon
            - With military impacts, $13/gallon
        - If prices reflected true cost:
            - More pressure on technological development
            - drastically different everyday decisions
- Humans want to manage nature, though we don't fully understand the consequences.

#### Why do we do this - Student Contributions

*More like "Why we don't do anything about it"*

- Unwillingness to change
- Lack of education
    - I agree with this.
    - We, in general, do not know that there is a problem.
        - We, in general, do not know how to address the problem.
- Assuming someone else will handle the issues
- minimize accountability / shifting blame
- Desensitization
- Desire for Personal Freedom
- Lack of exposure

#### Side-note: Neo-Liberal Economic Thought

*Freedom for business, anti-regulatory stance.*
