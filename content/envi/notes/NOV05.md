# Environmental Disease Day One

*What are mutations?*

mutagen - increases rate of genetic change

teratogen - substances that cause harm to a growing embryo or fetus

carcinogen - something that causes cancer

about 2% of cancers are genetic - there are strong environmental ties.

mutations in somatic cells are not inherited - mutations in germ cells are passed directly to future generations.

Point mutations
	- Simple Substitution, T->C
	- Addition - drop another one in there - caused a frame shift, because codons are read in groups of 3.
	- Deletion - also causes a fame shift

## Translocation

when some DNA exchanges a piece with another bit of DNA.

## non-disjunction

chomosomes don't separate perfectly during cell division - one cell has an extra, and one cell has one missing.
