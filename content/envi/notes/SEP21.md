# Climate Crisis

The natural greenhouse effect regulates heat on the planet.

- CO_2
- CH_4
- H_2 O
- O_3

When light hits the ground, it's wavelength goes way down. This lets it hit the assorted
"greenhouse gasses", and keeps it around for a little while.

year | CO_2
---|---
1700s | 278ppm


Humans have doubled the methane in the atmosphere and increased CO_2 by 40%.

We added some other things like nitrous oxides and refrigerants.

The burning of fossil fuels before 1950 resulted in over 1C temp increase today.
We have yet to see the effects of burns after 1950.

Tune in next time for Impacts - What happens because of this?
