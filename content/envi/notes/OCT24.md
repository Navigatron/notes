# Toxicology

## Exposure Pathways

Eating mercury is almost fine. Inhaling fumes is highly toxic.

## Exposure Duration

A lot over a short time vs a little all the time for a long time.

## History

- 1976 - Toxic Substances Control Act
	- Already using, fine.
	- New things should be tested
	- Since inception, has banned ~12 chemicals

## Susceptibility

varies a lot by many different factors.

> The Dose makes the Poison  
> Timing also makes the poison.

Implies that small enough amounts are okay. Things that unbalance the
endocrine system are pretty significant.

Exposure may not impact the individual, but the individuals offspring.

## Environmental Toxcicity

After we're done with them, they go somewhere.

POPS - persistent organic [something] [something]

Liver, heart, kidney, lungs - fatty organs bio-accumulate fat soluble toxins.

## PCBs

2 carbon rings surrounded by chlorine. Swedish researchers in 1964 found PCBs
*everywhere*. Deep sea trenches, polar bears, birds, all over.

PCBS are endocrine disruptors, along with many other things.

1 and 2 plastics are intended for single use - the plastic breaks down. Leaks
phthlates - bad stuff I guess.

There is pretty clear evidence that endocrine disruptors are causing birth defects.
