- There was some kind of alternate assignment due last Friday?
	- MyCourses provides a page of links?
- Read "The River Keepers"

# Air pollution Day Two

EPA comes into existence under Nixon

First focus, localized air pollution

- Make smokestacks taller
	- Less local pollution,
	- more area pollution

## Stratospheric Ozone

The "Ozone Layer" blocks 99% of the Sun's UV Radiation

1. UV hits O2, splitting it into two oxygen atoms
2. Single Oxygen atoms collide with O2, forming O3

Ozone naturally comes into existence, slowly.

### Chlorofluorocarbons

AC, spray cans, styrofoam, etc.

1. UV hits a CFC
2. Chlorine breaks off
3. Chlorine + O3 = Chlorine+O + O2
4. Single O hits the Chlorine+O = Chlorine + O2
5. Chlorine is free to go break another O3

## Effects of Ozone Depletion

If all ozone disappeared, there would be no life on land.

- Effects we've experienced
	- Skin Cancer
	- Cataracts
	- weakened immune system
	- reduced crop yield
	- Disrupts marine food chain

## What Do

- Montreal Protocol - reduce CFCs and other ozone depletion chems.
	- Amended 1995 to ban CFCs entirely

## Acid Rain

- Rain is naturally acidic, but becomes much more so.
- SO2 and NOx, from powerplants and automobiles respectively
- 1990, clean air act amended to add acid rain
	- Cap and Trade system
		- You get X allowed pollution, and can buy and sell pollution allowance

## Citizens Climate Lobby

working to enact carbon cap and trade system
