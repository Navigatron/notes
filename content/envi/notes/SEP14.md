# Environmental Principles

## Systems Thinking

We cannot understand a complex system by understanding each part.

## Biosphere

Zone of air/soil/water that supports life.

- atmosphere
- hydrosphere
- lithosphere

Life runs on energy - Heat is moved by ocean currents, air currents.

Broken up into smaller regions called *Biomes*

## Biomes

- Tundra
    - Permafrost is melting
        - Buildings are being abandoned
    - CH4, aka Methane, is in the ground there.
        - Methane is a pretty powerful greenhouse gas
        - More methane means more heat
            - More heat means more methane
                - More methane means more heat
                    - More heat means more methane
                        - ...
- Taiga
    - Pine trees
    - Pine beetle kills pine trees
        - Easier winters means more beetles
- Temperate Deciduous Forest
- Grassland
- Desert
- Tropical Rain-forest
