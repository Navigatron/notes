## Industrialization of a Country  
*Demographic Transition*

- Death Rate Drops
    - better sanitation
    - access to medical systems
    - foreign aid
- Birth Rate *also* Drops
    - Lower infant mortality
        - people have less children
    - needs of society
        - kids to work on the farm?
        - To take care of the old people?

Birth rate stabilizes slower than death rate. This lag behind creates an increase in population until both rates stabilize.
