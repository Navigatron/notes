# Housekeeping

"Alternate assignment" from last class overdue now

> Note, december 4th: I never figured out what the alternate assignment was

# Air Pollution

- atmospheric stratification
	- atmosphere divided into layers
	- we live in the troposphere, from here to 6 miles up
	- top is Thermosphere, 62 miles up
- Ozone (O_3)
	- Can be Good
		- Naturally occurring
		- in stratosphere
		- filters out UV light (Mission Critical) [UV is very bad]
	- Can be Bad
		- Man made
		- Ground level (Troposphere)
		- Corrosive
			- Damages Lungs
			- Damages Plants
- Sources of Air Pollution
	- Natural
		- Dust storms, volcanoes, forest fires
	- Man Made
		- Transportation
		- Electric power generation
			- Coal
			- Oil
		- Industry
			- steel
			- metal
			- oil
			- paper
	- Primary Pollutants
		- Carbon Monoxide
		- Sulfur Oxides
		- others
- Combustion
	- Incomplete Combustion
		- leaves behind CO2, H2O and Hydrocarbons
		- Contaminated with heavy metals
- Clean Air Act
	- Particulate
	- SO2
		- Comes from burning coal
		- SO2 + H2O = Sulfuric Acid
	- CO
		- odorless, colorless
		- Ethanol reduces air pollution by increasing efficiency
	- NOx
		- Photo-chemical Smog
	- O3
	- Lead
		- Inspired by Leaded Gasoline

Lead exposure negatively impacts the "calm-down" hormone. All countries that
have removed leaded gasoline have also seen a decrease in crime.

Use cold water when cooking to avoid lead exposure

High efficiency diesel engines produce ultra-fine particulate matter, which can
build up in the brain - This is why we see those "No idling" signs at gas stations

- Volatile Organic Compounds
	- Higher concentrations indoors
	- Markers, new shoe smell, products.
	- formaldehyde - carcinogen - cheap particle board
- Smog
	- Industrial
		- Gray / Blue
		- Cold, moist climate
		- coal and oil
	- photo-chemical
		- Orange / Brown
		- Warm, Dry, Sunny
		- Auto Exhaust
			- VOCs and NOx form Ozone, secondary pollutant
- Inversion
	- Weather condition that traps pollutants at ground level
	- Killed 4k during an event in London, 1952
	- India
		- Chemical leak during inversion effect killed 15k
- Affects
	- Respiratory problems
	- lung cancer
