# Fundamentals of Risk management

The Big Formula:

$$
\text{risk} = \text{probability} \cdot \text{impact}
$$

The risk of an incident $i$:

$$
\text{risk}(i) = \text{probability}(i) \cdot \text{impact}(i)
$$

Risk's three main ingredients:

- An incident
- The likelihood of that incident
- The impact (consequence) of that incident

How to manage risk:

- Assess what risk there is
- Implement a risk management strategy to make it less
- Monitoring / feedback to keep it less

NIST says you can manage risk in three layers:

- Organizational
- Business Process
- Information Systems - specific to cyber stuff

Senior Executives are important:

- They set the risk tolerance level
- Their buy-in strengthens a risk-management program

Risk management should follow a *Framework* based on the core *Principles*.

- Principles guide the framework
- Framework guides the process
- Lessons from the process morph the framework

ISO 31000 is a good list of rM Principles

Risk management process:

- Assess the risk
- Communicate about it?
	- Talk to stakeholders
	- Determine the best way to mitigate it
- Monitor and Review

Risk *Assessment* process:

- Establish Context
	- Goals and Objectives
- Risk identification
	- What are the risks
- Risk Analysis
	- How risky are the risks
- Risk Evaluation
	- Is the risk risky enough to warrant a control?
	- Can we group this with other risks?
- Risk Treatment
	- Avoid
	- Transfer / Share
	- Accept
	- Mitigate

> What are your metrics of success? (KPIs)  
> Following, what's the impact on those KPIs?

Risk Levels can be *Quantitative* or *Qualitative*

- Quantitative - numbers
	- Interval - no true zero (temperature F/C)
	- Ratio - true zero exists (temperature K, length)
- Qualitative
	- Nominal - BMW/Audi/Subaru
	- Ordinal - slow/average/speedy

Risk Identification always needs:

- Assets - something to harm
	- My IT systems
- Vulnerabilities - Some way to harm an asset
	- Microsoft RDP
- Threats - Something that could do the harm
	- Hackers wanting ransom
