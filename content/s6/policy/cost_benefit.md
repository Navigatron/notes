# Cost Benefit Analysis

> In 1981, President Ronald Reagan required CBA for all major rules.

CBA asks two major questions:

- What are the costs of a decision?
- What are the benefits of a decision?
- Do the benefits outweigh the costs?

These are the general steps of CBA:

1. Define the situation
	- including geographic scope!
2. Identify the costs
3. Identify the benefits
4. Discount future costs and benefits to identify net present value (NPV)
5. Interpret results

## Net Present Value

Some costs / benefits occur in the future, and some occur now. $1 now is not worth the same as $1 in two years.

The *Present Value* of X money is the amount you would be willing to pay *now* to receive X in the future.

Let's define some terms:

- $r$ is the interest rate
- $FV$ is the future value of some money
- $PV$ is the present value
- $t$ is a number of years

If we have \$100, we can determine how much that will be worth in $t=10$ years, given an interest rate of $r=5%$.

$$
FV = PV * (1+r)^t\\
FV = 100 * (1+0.05)^{10}\\
FV = 100 * 1.05^{10}\\
FV = 100 * 1.62889462678\\
FV = 162.89
$$

If we are instead given the future value, we can determine the present value.

$$
PV = FV / (1+r)^t
$$

## Other things that affect the discount rate

- inflation
- future generations

## Benefit - Cost Ratio

Divide the PV of benefits by the PV of costs. This represents *efficiency*.
