# Week 1

We want these:

- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Authentication
- Non-repudiation

> See the security properties notes from Forensics last semester

Cryptology can be broken into:

- Cryptanalysis - Breaking cryptosystems
	- Classical Cryptanalysis
		- Mathematical Analysis
		- Brute-force attacks
	- Implementation Attacks
	- Social Engineering
- Cryptography
	- Symmetric Ciphers
	- Asymmetric Ciphers
	- Protocols

Encryption of Plaintext yields Ciphertext:

$$
e_K(x) = y
$$

Decryption of Ciphertext yeilds Plaintext:

$$
d_K(y) = x
$$

The set of all keys is the **Key Space**:

$$
\text{keyspace} = \{ K_1, K_2,\dots ,K_n \}
$$

If the same key is used, encryption and decryption are inverse operations:

$$
d_K(e_K(x)) = y
$$

**Kerckhoff's Principle**:

> A cryptosystem should be secure even if the attacker knows all the details about the system, with the exception of the secret key

Meaning: *Do not roll-your-own cryptosystem*

## Shift Cipher

Where $ k, x, y \in \{ 0, 1, 2, \dots , 25 \} $

$$
\begin {align}
y = e_K(x) = x + k \bmod 26 \\
x = d_K(y) = y -k \bmod 26
\end {align}
$$
