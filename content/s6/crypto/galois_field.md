# Galois Fields

> A field is a set of integers, such that operations on the integers result in other elements of the set.

Galois showed that for a field to be finite, the number of elements should be some power of a *prime*, aka $p^n$.

A Galois Field $GF(p^n)$ is a finite field with $p^n$ elements.

When $n=1$:

$$
GF(p^n) = GF(p) = Z_p = \{0,1,...,p-1\}
$$
