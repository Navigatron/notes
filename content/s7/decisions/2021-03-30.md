Book review:

- Chapter 1: 2008 Financial Crisis
    - 1.2% chance the CDO would fail
    - In reality, it was 28%
- Chapter 2: TV experts are pretty bad
    - Hedgehogs vs Foxes
    - think probabilistically
- Chapter 4: Accuweather
    - Weather reporting is biased towards wet
    - Except the nat. weather service
    - We want our forecasters to be accurate

> Out of Sample: extrapolating; predicting something far away from our sampled data

For Assignment 4, write down the counties as they appear, even if they are wrong.
