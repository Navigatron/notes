We do estimation because we can't find the exact data point we're looking for. Our estimation should be based on other data that we *can* find.

- Identify all the assumptions your estimation is based on
- Draw from experience and basic data sources
- Use statistics if needed
- Be creative, but be logical and able to justify decisions

- Is the answer with the most net benefit, the best option?
- The BCA doesn't tell you how benefits are distributed

Some issues:

- selecting evaluation concept
	- How to value the loss of 100 swimming salmon?
		- current market price?
		- post-loss market price?
		- environmental impact?
- Discount rates?
- Who's benefits / costs should be counted?
