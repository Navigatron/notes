Assignment 5 is out! Readings have been assigned (I have chapter 6).

## Studentized Residuals

Recall, the residual is each point's distance from the best fit line. Rather than showing the residuals along the original Y axis, show them against the normal distribution of the residuals (Y = std. devs. from average).

This scales the data along the Y axes, converting the units into standard deviations. 95% of the data should be within 2 std devs.

In the "Rocket Fuel" data set, studentized residuals quickly reveal two points as clear outliers.

## What to do with outliers?

You probably don't want to ignore them completely. If you can leave them in, maybe you should.

## The Q-Q Plot

Sort the data points and plot them against the expected percentile for the normal distribution
