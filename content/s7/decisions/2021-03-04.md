It's time to buy the textbook: "Signal and the Noise" by Nate Silver. $18 hardcover on Amazon.

## SRI/CMU Protocol

We will have to do this for assignment three.

- understand the issue
- Know what you want to know
- Explain the protocol and common issues with human elicitation
- Discuss the issue *without* elicitation
    - discuss the topic qualitatively
    - discover what elements and issues are important
- Begin structuring the elicitation
- Do the actual elicitation
    - Get estimates and confidence intervals
    - Use models / units that make it easy for the expert
    - Talk about the reasons behind the answers
    - Encourage extreme numbers - what really is the 98th CI

There are examples on myCourses.
