Bill works in the *Intellectual Property and Tech Transfer Office*.

Inventions come into the IP&TT office. It must be:

- Novel
- Non-Obvious
- Useful

If the idea doesn't match these, it gets kicked back to the inventor. Bill also wants the inventors to make sure nothing already exists in the public domain before they come to him.

If the idea passes, they help get the idea through the patent and licensing phases.

## Examples

VPG medical detects aphib via cellphones.

BlackBox Biometrics monitors health data in real time, as part of a warfighter uniform, to detect concussive injuries.

Innovation Semiconductor can put LED lights **very** (and I mean *very*) close together - and pretty cheaply, too.

Falcon Fuel Cells creates propane-based fuel cells that are very energy dense.
