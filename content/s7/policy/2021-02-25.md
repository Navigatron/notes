The term project accounts for 40% of the final grade. It has a mid-semester essay and an end-of-semester essay (and an oral presentation).

The topics are very open-ended - Chose a policy, and look at how it affected invention and innovation - or pick a technology, and look at how it affected policy. Or pick something else, it's very open.

As the course continues, we'll start to look at policy instruments and how they affect technological change.

3D printing is cool, but largely unregulated - it will be difficult to write a long paper on how it interacts with policy.

> 3D printing firearms, however, is a hot topic and is currently facing regulation, especially in New York state I believe.
