Biometric error rates:

- Fraud: Allowing an Impersonator
- Insult: Rejecting a valid supplicant

The ideal sensitivity is where the fraud rate and the insult rate are equal.

## Fingerprints

- They don't change
- They have features, or "minutia"

In Britain, they require 15 minutia to match for fingerprints to be considered the same. The US requires a 98.5% confidence level, using statistical methods.

Fingerprints are great for authentication - you can tell if the supplicant matches the stored measurements. Fingerprints aren't as good for identification, because the search space is huge.

## Hand Geometry

High error rate, can't be used on the very old or very young.

## Iris Patterns

Iris development is chaotic, with little to no genetic influence. Iris's differ, even in identical twins. The patterns are also stable through the lifetime.
