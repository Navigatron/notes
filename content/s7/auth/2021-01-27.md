# Project Overview

Students are split into teams of roughly 5.

## Source Summaries

Every week, each student will find *at least* two academic papers on the chosen topic to summarize. Sources should be no older than 5 years. Information from the paper must be entered into the *Source Summary Tracker*.

## The Source Summary Tracker

The tracker is a google sheet. Each row represents a different paper, and each column represents a different feature (or set of features) about the paper.

Every week, the tracker must be exported to PDF and uploaded to MyCourses.

## The wireframe

Halfway through the semester, teams will boil their source summaries into a single research question. This will be used in the final project.

## The Final Project

The final project is a "Literature Review". The goal is to be of sufficient quality to be accepted to a mid-level academic journal.
