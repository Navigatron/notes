## SysLog

The de-facto logging standard.

- what is generating the log
- the log level
- ...

## Auditing

Provides accountability for actions, baiscally just logging. SELinux in permissive mode will log each time a policy *would* be violated, without blocking.

`auditd` uses `/etc/audit.rules`

## Wireframe

> "The structure of your argument, what you did and why you did it. Really an outline." - Prof.

No minimum page requirements, no complete sentences needed. An example will be... somewhere.

## Split

We split into breakout rooms to work on the lab.
