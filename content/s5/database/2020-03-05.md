> I got a few terminology things wrong

- class &rarr; *entity* class
- Rows of a database aren't instances, they're *tuples*
	- I disagree with this question
	- Both are valid answers
	- And the question doesn't distinguish between which of those is better.
- Transitive dependencies in the functional dependencies don't count
- MEI statements only need to specify the primary key once
	- Really?
	- So, if A(1) references C(1) and B(1) references C(1), only one statement needs to exist?
