Single quotes are required for string literals and dates, as double quotes do not work in some DBMS systems.

What we have so far:

- DDL - data definition language
- DML - data manipulation language

Commands:

- `USE <name>`
- `SHOW <name>`
- `DESCRIBE <name>`
- `CREATE [DATABASE|TABLE] <name>`
- `DROP [DATABASE|TABLE] <name>`

```
CREATE DATABASE conman;
SHOW DATABASES; -- ensure all goes well
USE conman; -- use the db we just created
SHOW TABLES; -- throws an error if not using a db
```

Datatypes:

- `CHAR (size)`
	- fixed-length string
- `VARCHAR (size)`
	- variable length string
- `INT` or `INTEGER`
- `DATE`

Rules that limit the values of an attribute, aka Constraints:

- in creating a table: `CONSTRAINT constraint_name CONSTRAINT TYPE (arguments)`
- `PRIMARY KEY`
	- every value must be unique
	- not null

Creating a table:

```
CREATE TABLE tablename(
	attr1 datatype,
	attr2 datatype,
	CONSTRAINT tablename_pk PRIMARY KEY (primary key attributes)
);
```

Look at the table's metadata with SHOW or DESCRIBE.

Looks like `DESCRIBE` is just a shortcut for `SHOW COLUMNS` that only exists for oracle compatability.

## Scripts

`myScript.sql` contains a semi-colon (`;`) delimited list of SQL commands.

load in a script with `SOURCE <filepath>`, or the shortcut `\.`

## in-class example

- `conman` database
- `contact_info` table

Now - inserting data into the db

```
INSERT INTO tablename (attr1, attr2) VALUES (attr1val, attr2val);
```

If a value is being added for every attribute, then the attr names do not need to be specified. However, the order must still be maintained.

## Getting info out

`SELECT *| attr1, attr2 FROM tablename;`

use an alias for an attribute:

`SELECT attr1 AS 'alias' FROM tablename;`

## Conditional Selection - WHERE

`SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE attr1='clean warm socks';`

finding null things: `WHERE attr1 IS NULL;`
