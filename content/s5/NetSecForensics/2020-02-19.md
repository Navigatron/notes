# 2020-02-19 - getting started with ipSec

An adversary can attack three things in a secure system:

- The crypto-scheme itself, the primitives (note: not the implementation).
	- for example, AES-256
	- This is very hard
- Protocols and policies
	- for example, HTTP
	- This is hard
- Implementation
	- for example, Apache

## IPSec

Two Protocols

- AH
	- Authentication Header
	- for authenticating
	- secures Src/Dst IP, Incompatible with NAT
- ESP
	- Encrypts *and* authenticates

Two Modes

- Transport
- Tunnel
