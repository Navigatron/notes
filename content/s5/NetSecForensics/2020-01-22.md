Processes are designed and modeled.

A *Safety Property* is a statement about a process model that states that a certain bad event will not happen. For example, when washing a car, the car will not catch on fire.

A *Progress Property* is a statement about a process model that states that a certain good thing will happen. For example, when washing a car, the car will become clean.

Where *Safety* is protection from unintentional mishaps, *Security* defends specifically against an *Adversary*.

Adversaries are modeled as well:

- Who are they?
	- Identify your likely threat actors
- What actions can they take?
	-

> Who has a strong adversary? Edward Snowden

Some Adversaries:

- Script Kiddies
- Hacktivists
- Corporate Espionage
- Cyber criminals
- APT groups
- Nation-State Actors

> H.B's Duo just got triggered? Right in front of the class? Someone has his password?

Port:

- The left side of a boat
- A sweet wine
- Something a wire plugs into
- A socket that a process can listen on

"Confused Deputy Attacks"

CIA - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability - These are Security Properties

There is a new acronym: STRIDE
