Simplest firewall architecture: Screening Router. The path to the internet goes through the router, which has a firewall running.

A firewall is easy to build on a router, because routers are already looking at the packet headers.

A screening router is:

- Simple and fast
- not flexible
	- permits or denies an entire protocol
- no depth of defense
- Appropriate only in high-performance networks with hardened hosts.

Dual Homed Host:

- A computer with two network interfaces
- Can behave exactly like a router
- More powerful than a router - can look beyond the headers
- High level of control
- Could be a bottleneck - lots of work
- Single point of failure
- not great for proxying inbound services
- no separation between high and low trust services

Screened Host:

- A host within the internal network becomes a *bastion host*
	- Still does proxying
	- only needs one interface
- And there's a packet-filtering router
- packet filter blocks all inbound traffic except to bastion
- Internal hosts may create outbound connections
- bastion host is still a single point of failure and open to attack

Screened Subnet:

- There is an external router, internet &rarr; DMZ
	- 'access router'
- There is a bastion host in the DMZ
- There is an internal router, DMZ &rarr; internal network
	- 'choke router'
- Internal hosts are still not separated from each other
- Compromising the bastion host does not gain much
- if own router is compromised, the other will keep filtering.
- ISPs will do this, DMZ between internet and customers
- Exterior router
	- lightweight
	- filters spoofed packets

Split-Screened Subnet:

- External router
- dual-homed Host
- Internal router
- All the fun of a dual-homed host in a delicious DMZ package.
