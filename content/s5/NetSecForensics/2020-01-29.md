There are kinda four layers:

- IP Source Guard
- DAI
- DHCP
- Port Security

Each level provides additional security for the layer above.

- Resource Exhaustion on the Switch
	- Send from lots of MACs to fill the forwarding table
- DHCP Resource Exhaustion
	- Send  lots of requests to eat all the IPs
- DHCP Rogue Server
	- Set Default Gateway to something attacker controlled
	- Set DNS Server to something attacker controlled
	- wrong IP

Protect against DHCP shenanigans by using DHCP Snooping

- Offer / Ack / Nak can only come from trusted server
- Attackers cannot release your lease for you
- Checks CHADDR matches actual source - maybe?
- Can also verify ARP replies (Dynamic Arp Inspection)

Dolev-Yao Adversary - user of the network can spoof, tamper, use own crypto key, cannot break other crypto.
