Firewalls are a kind of access control

These three things are close together:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Access Control

Subjects vs Objects

- Subject
	- An entity that may perform an action
	- Like a process
- Object
	- An entity on which an action can be performed
	- Like a file

Access Control List - ACL - a list attached to an object that says what subjects may perform what action

There are two kinds of firewalls:

- Packet Filtering
	- Looks at packet headers, maybe something else
	- can look at source and dest port
	- might know things from past packets (statefull)
- Proxy Servers

They can do other things too:

- NAT
- VPN Endpoint

This will be on the test:

> When the IP header 'next protocol' field is '4', it means the content is *another* IP packet.

Levels of Inspection:

- Header inspection
- Deep Packet Inspection
- Deep Content Inspection

Things firewalls and such can do about packets:

- Accept the packet
- Drop the packet
- Reject it loudly

Things firewalls typically also do:

- Log some information
- Fire an alert if something is very scary

Oh boy more things they can do:

- Modify the packet, like NAT
- Load balancing (all hail the load balancers)

"Why even have little firewalls?" -> "It's a good first line of defense in depth"

## Linux Firewall Structure

`netfilter` provides hooks into the packet processing stack. `iptables` allows the user to read/write packet processing *policy*.

IPTables has multiple *Tables*, each of which has many *Chains*, each of which has many *Rules*.

Tables:

- raw
- filter
- nat
- mangle

Chains - in order of when they hit:

- PREROUTING
	- Triggered when a packet is received
	- Given to INPUT or FORWARD depending on the destination
- INPUT
	- for packets we are going to welcome into our house
- FORWARD
	- for packets we are going to send, from someone else
- OUTPUT
	- for packets we are going to send, from us
- POSTROUTING
	- For putting things in our outbound mailbox
