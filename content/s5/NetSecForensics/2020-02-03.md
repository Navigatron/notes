## Big project

- Groups of 3 or 4 are ideal
- Short presentation at end of the semester
- something related to network security
- Three things people really like:
	- "here's this cool tool, or problem, I'll run the tool, share results"
		- "Here's this firewall, we looked at what traffic our ISP sends us, here's results"
	- "We have a lab assignment, let's add a lot of extra material to it"
	- Replicate the results of a paper from a conference

Past groups:

- Tunneled info out via dns
	- Tunneling is putting x data in y format, to get it somewhere
- Did a lab on exploiting spanning tree protocol

To do:

- Form a team
- choose a topic
- email prof. with the above info
- prof will provide feedback

## Review

- DHCP Snooping
	- Switch builds model of IP associations
- Dynamic ARP Inspection
	- Switch blocks ARP replies that don't match the model

## IP Spoofing

Attacker sends message with incorrect source IP address. The victim cannot reply, as the response goes to the machine with that actual address.

If the attacker sends a message with an incorrect IP *and* mac, they can still be detected with the DHCP snooping table, as the table records associations *with switch interfaces*.

This completes the pyramid

- Port security
- DHCP Snooping
- Dynamic ARP Inspection
- IP Source Guard

Thusly ends switch security.

## Firewalls

Not a wall made of fire. It stops fire.

General principles of a secure system:

- Simplicity
	- Choke point - force attackers to use a narrow channel
	- Least privilege: Don't allow more than you need
- Defense in depth
	- Have multiple security mechanisms
	- Diversity of defense - have many different security mechanisms
	- More than one thing must go wrong before a system dies
- Fail-safe stance
	- Fail in a way that denies access
- Weakest link
	- one broken link can endanger the network
