**TL;DR**: *Assessments* lead to *Policies* which can be *Audited*

## What is auditing

- testing something against a standard
- with evidence

## Auditing vs Assessing

- Audit
	- There is a standard
	- Comparison of reality against the standard
	- 'how do you know' that something matches/doesn't
	- Often includes assessing
- Assess
	- Subjective Measurement
	- Questions
		- What security issues exist?
		- How good/bad is something
		- What needs to be done to improve something

*Assessments* lead to *Policies* which can be *Audited*.

## three-levels of auditing

- Policy
	- Is the policy effective
	- is it followed
- Procedure
	- how are things happening
- System / app level

## What is a Policy

- Plan of action, influences decisions
	- "Administrative control"
- for effectivenmess:
	- Disseminated
	- read
	- understoofd
	- agreed to
	- enforced
- Must be maintained

## Security Control Functions

- Deterrent
- Directive
- Preventative
- Detective
- Corrective
- Compensating
- Recovery

## Policy vs Procedure

- Policy
	- What/why you can/can't have/do
	- mostly based on some standard
	- "The employees can come in the building in the morning."
- Procedure
	- who/what/when/how of policy
	- who does what when and how
	- "Greg shall unlock the doors at 7AM"

## Policy examples

- Password policy
	- "12 characters or more"
- Email policy
	- "work-related email only"
- Sensitive Info Handling policy
- Anti-virus software policy

> No USB sticks.

- "All user-level passwords must be changed at least every 6 months"

## Procedure example

"The system administrator will ensure that the password are changed by blocking users offending the policy after n time expires"

> read policies from RIT, from otheruniversities, ISPs, etc.
