Assignment #1 has not been enabled on MyCourses, so the due date is delayed until next week.

There's an independent study op, working with the NIST NICE framework to measure CSEC skills.

## What is Auditing?

- Verifying that a set of standards are being followed
	- Does the model of what's happening match what's actually happening?

What standards do we compare against?

- External Standards
	- NIST
	- PCI
	- HIPAA
	- SOX
	- SOC2
- Internal Standards
	- Internal Security Policies

How to verify that existing passwords are compliant with policy?

- Expire everything
- Store it in plaintext?
- Crack their hashes

RIT wrote a script:

- In an isolated, sandbox environment,
- Crack each user's password,
- verify against standards,
- If broken, send email and expire in 5 days
- Wipe memory

An audit should provide business value.

- Generate interesting results
- Provide actionable information

## Assignment 1 updated

- Read the CIS benchmark for an OS you use
- Find two things you'll fix
- Find three things you won't fix, tell why not.
