Sounds like OSQuery and Ansible?

Ansible is a configuration management tool that can affect multiple boxes at once. It's great for deploying things and setting things up.

If you've got a box with SSH, ansible can manage it. No agent required.

## Inventories

Ansible needs targets to work with. An *Inventory* is just a list of targets.

A simple inventory is just a list of IPs.

Or, things can be in groups.

```
[web]
hostname1
hostname2

[db]
hostname3
```

Looks like INI format.

Patterns:

- Single
	- just X
- Inclusive
	- X and Y
- Exclusive
	- All of X except Y
- Unions
	- X and Y again I guess

Specify things from most to least specific.

All actions describe tasks, which describe a state. Expressed in YAML.

In other words, define a state in YAML. Ansible then performs the *task* of getting a machine to that state.

Task control:

- Looping
- privesc
- conditionals

Idempotence - Ansible has it, scripts do not.

Tasks return data, like what they did.

Modules? Oh boy. "bits of code". hmmmmm.
