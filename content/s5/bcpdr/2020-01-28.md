- DR
- and IR

Move reflections from CPA3 to content notes.

IR is what you do while an event is happening. How to cope with security events.

NIST IR Framework

- Prep
- Detection and Analysis (Identification)
- Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
- Post-incident activity

IR Policy

- Statement of commitment
- objectives
- scope
- incident definition
- R&R matrix
- Severity matrix
- Reporting and Contact information

Plan and policy are related but not the same

CSIRT := Computer Security Incident Response Team

## IR Response Strategy

- Create new sheet in case study risk analysis doc
	- IS Incident Desc
	- Likelihood
	- Impact
	- Mitigation Cost
	- Risk Score
- Brainstorm incidents that would affect the case study

## IR Plan

- Create new doc in case study folder
- Create headings
	- Identification
	- Containment
	- Eradication
	- Recovery
	- Lessons Learned

> It appears the case study is a mirror of what we will need to do on our own

- Define
	- Term Incident
	- Severity Scheme
	- Incident Categories
	- Complete table:
		- Incident Category
		- IS Incident Description
		- Severity
		- Severity Description

Containment

- Create table: R&R for taking system down

Eradication

- identify who is responsible for identifying impacted systems
- Identify the who is responsible for repairing impacted systems

## Reflection

- What did you learn about impact analysis and/or about evaluating risk in today's class?
- What were your challenges when trying to complete the class activities?
	- categories
- Do you have any outstanding questions about these topics?
