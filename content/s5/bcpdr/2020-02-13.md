## Questions

- Redundancy in different plans
	- Information is duplicated among many plans
	- because it needs to be immediately available
	- Can't go flipping about during an emergency
- Employee push-back
	- People feel out of their depth
	- push back, "I don't know how to even start"
- Fictitious Architecture
	- Real architectures are just as difficult, don't worry
- Administrative Plan
	- We're only doing a departmental plan
	- So we aren't using all the sections
- Plan Tracking
	- We can make a glossary
	- And a flowchart to decide what plan to use
- How do we know out plans are right?
	- We gotta do testing.

## Team Contract Review

- It's a living document
