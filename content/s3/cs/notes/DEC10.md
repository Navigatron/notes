# Pipelining day 2

Hazards are problems that arise from pipelining.

To avoid a hazard, we can duplicate components. We can duplicate anything that
does not need to be written to.


On the Final:
Data Hazard
- read/write order out of whack
- When instruction 1 writes to reg1, and the next instruction depends on reg1.
