# Eat

Butter enhances everything here (Except the oatmeal)

## Breakfast

### Coffee Maker Oatmeal (Every Day, 10 seconds)

- Instant oatmeal with hot water from the coffee machine

### Eggs (15 mins)

- Submerge in warm water for 5 mins prior to cooking for light, fluffy eggs
- Fried over easy, scrambled with milk, whatever works
- Toast is good with this

### 10/10 Brekky (Expensive, takes time)
