# Nucleic Acids

Nucleotides are polymers of nucleic acids

Phosphate Group + Sugar (deoxyribose) + Nitrogen Base (adenine)

- sugar is specific to DNA. it's something else in RNA
- adenine is one example, there are others.
	- Adenine
	- Thymine
	- Cytosine
	- Guanine
- In RNA, we've got Uracil instead of Thymine

Phosphate group is hydrophilic

In DNA, opposite bases form hydrogen bonds.

DNA stays in the nucleus, and holds all the info.

*Transcription* copies DNA onto mRNA, which goes out into the cell.

*Translation* uses the data on mRNA to build an amino acid chain.

*Folding* turns the amino acid chain into a protein.

# Cells

- prokaryote vs eukaryote
- location, structure, basic function of organelles
- How they make proteins, lipids, carbs
- How to recycle/destroy
- The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
- movement and shape
- plants vs animals
- cell communication

## Shapes and Sizes

There are many.

## Eu vs pro

- Pro and euk
	- plasma membrane
	- 1+ chromosomes
	- ribosomes
		- NOT an organelle
- Euk only
	- membrane-bound nucleus
		- In pro, the nucleus is just kinda floatin' around
	- True Organelles

## Prokaryotes

- Around the juicy inside
	- Plasma membrane (innermost layer)
		- Control imports and exports
	- cell wall
		- Structure
	- capsule (outermost layer)
		- Defense
- tend to live in nasty places
- very simple structure

## Eukaryotes

- Major organelle catagories
	- Genetic Control
	- Breakdown, Manufacture, and Distro materials
	- Energy Processing
	- Structural Support, Movement, Communication

## Organelles - Animal

- Golgi Apparatus
	- Encase a protein in a package (vescicle)
	- Ship it out the door
- Nucleolis
	- little nucleus
	- in the middle of the nucleus
	- makes ribosomes
- nucleus
	- Holds DNA
	- Double phospholipid bilayer
	- pores connected the layers, let mRNA out, nothing in.
- Rough endoplasmic reticulum
	- Makes proteins
- Smooth endoplasmic reticulum
	- Break down fats and alchohols
		- Alchohols from breakdown process
- Mitochondria
	- Cellular Respiration
	- Food -> ATP
- Lysosome (Garbage Truck)
	- Digest something that comes in
	- Eats worn out mitochondria
	- Toxic? Isolates and expells.
- Proxisomes
	- Break down alchohols
- Centrisomes and Centrioles
	- used in cell division
- Cytoskeleton
	- Microtubules
	- Microfilament
	- Intermediate Filament

## Organelles - Plants

Lots of things are the same, there are some differences

- Mitocondria
- smooth / rough ER
- Chloroplast
	- Site of photosynthesis
- No Lysosomes
	- Instead we got the central vacuole
- Peroxisomes
- Plasmodesmada
	- Tunnel between this cell and another through the wall
	- Moves materials and communication

## Endosymbiotic Theory

Mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes

Structure very similar to prokaryotic Cells

They act on their own.

Ye who ate a mitochondria at some point is now super-powered compared to other cells. We think this is what happened.

## Cytoskeleton

- Microfilaments
- Intermediate fillaments
	- Super strong
- Microtubules
	- Made in centrisomes
	- Look like straws

## Animal Cell Junctions

- Tight Junctions
	- prevent fluid movement
- Anchoring junctions
	- ?
	- Probably anchoring
- Gap Junctions
	- Allow things to flow between

## Plant cell junctions

- plasmodesmata
