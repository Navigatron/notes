# Photosynthesis

Reduction = reducing charge = adding electrons. We're adding electrons to CO2
along with Hydrogen ions (from water) to create sugars

Water molecules are oxidized, stealing hydrogen ions and electrons.

## Light Reaction

We'll still need electron carriers (NADP, fasomething)

Doesn't actually create sugar

Happens in the thylakoid

H2O + Light -> O2; also converts NADP+ to NADPH; ADP+P to ATP

NADPH and ATP goto calvin cycle in Stroma

> stOHma are OHpenings in leaves, here stroma is the area in the chloroplast outside the thylakoids.

### PhotoSystem II

#### Side tangent: Light
- Visible light drives photosynthesis, 680 and 700nm
- Longer = infrared (red), shorter = UV (blues)
- shorter wavelength, lots of energy per photon. This is why UV damages things.
- Leaves are green because they reflect green light.
- As days grow shorter, leaves die, chlorophyll dies, other colors are revealed.
- Carotinid(?) in carrots, absorbs some UV, internal sunscreen for water creatures.

Photosynthetic pigment (P680) absorbs light to split water and spit out electrons.

Electrons bounce along the electron transport chain



### PhotoSystem I

P700 absorbs light,

### Calvin Cycle

CO2 -> Sugar; also converts NADPH to NADP+; ATP to ADP+P

3CO2s take 9ATP, 6NADPH, tons of other things. Very intensive.

Sunlight builds up NADPH, so we can do this all day as long as we have reserves.

Easy Mode:  
3CO2 + 3ATP + 6ATP + 6NADP => G3P

G3P can be made into Glucose, Cellulose, Starch...

## "Dark" Reaction

*Light Independent*

Powered by electron carriers, this stage puts the carbon things together into sugars.

x | PhotoSystem II | Electron Transport Chain | psI, aka p700 | Calvin Cycle
---|---
Location | thylakoids | <- | <- | Stroma
materials Needed | H2O, visible light | electrons from p680 | e from etc, light | CO2, NADPH, Rubisco, ATP
Products | O2,ATP | Just moves em | NADPH | G3P, rubisco, NADP+, ADP+P
reduced | p680 | X | NADP->NADPH | CO2 to make G3P
Oxidized | H2O | X | p700 | NADPH

## C3 plants
- most plants
- use carbon right from the air
- use stoma to regulate air exchange and water

## C4 plants
- Corn!
- Keep the stoma mostly closed
- Don't use rubisco, fix CO2 into 4 carbon compound
- preserve water better
- Energy intensive

## CAM plants
- exxxtreeme
- Only ever open stomata at night
- Banks CO2 at night, fixes into 4-carbon compound
- release CO2 into calvin cycle during day
- very slow growth plants
