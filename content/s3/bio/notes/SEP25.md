# Energy

Kinetic energy is happening right now, potential energy is stored.

We like to store energy for use later.

Exergonic reactions release energy

Endergonic reactions require energy and store it.

We turn glucose into ATP, CO_2 and Water. Then we use the ATP to power something.

When we use the energy in an ATP, we break off a part of the phosphate, and it becomes ADP. When we store energy, we put the phosphate back together, and it becomes ATP again.

We can use ATP for all kinds of things.

# Enzymes

Here to help us do endo/exo gonic reactions.

- amylase
    - saliva
    - breaks down sugars
- Lipase
    - fat degrading
    - small intestine
    - Higher pH
- Porotease
    - Stomach
    - Low pH (~2)

Enzyme's shape defines what they do.

**Substrates** bind with the enzyme, then the enzyme acts on them.

The **Active Site** of an enzyme is where the substrates attach.

Hexokinase enzyme is a pal that breaks down glucose.

pH and Temp affect the reaction rate of enzymes.

## Time

More substrate, more production.

More Enzymes, more production.

More of both, chaotic, all over the place, body loves it. So much production.

- Competitive Inhibition
    - Thing looks like substrate
    - Binds to enzyme
- Non-Competitive
    - Thing binds to the enzyme, changes shape of enzyme
    - substrate no longer fits.

We do the above on purpose to regulate internal function.
