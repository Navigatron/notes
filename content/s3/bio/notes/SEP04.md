## Warm up - filler, skip this.

*The Relationship between Chemistry and Biology*

- Bio is 'powered' by Chem

*Emergent Properties, Defining Bio, >> Blue Notebooks*

## The Moose - a preview of the future - filler, skip this.

- All the energy on this planet comes from the sun
- Energy cannot be created or Destroyed
- Sausage Egg and Cheese Sandwich -> ATP (Adenosine triphosphate)

In chapter 2:  
- Building Molecules with Bonds
- Hydrophobic / Hydrophilic
- pH
    - blood = 6.7->7
    - Stomach = 2
    - small intestine = 10

## Chemistry is everything

Things that change your chem:  
- Drugs
- Sleep

Carbon, Oxygen, Hydrogen, Nitrogen make up 96% of a human

Other things, from most to least:  
Calcium, Phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, magnesium, others.

## compounds

Compound = 2+ elements in a fixed ratio

Sodium (Na) + Chlorine (Cl, deadly) = Sodium Chloride (NaCl), aka table salt.

## Atoms and Isotopes

Atoms consist of:
- Protons
    - In the nucleus
    - Positive Charge
- Electrons
    - Orbit nucleus
    - Negative Charge
    - Involved in bonds
- Neutrons
    - No charge
    - in the nucleus

Atoms want to be neutrally charged -> same amount of protons and electrons.

Isotopes:
- Same number of protons as base element
- Different # of neutrons

Hydrogen + neutrons + oxygen = H3O aka deuterium aka heavy water.  
Take it further, get tritium.

## Electrons!

Electron Shell Goals:  
1. 2
2. 8

Carbon has 6 by default, leaving 4 in the outer shell. It wants 8, so Carbon
teams up with 4 hydrogen bros to create CH4, aka Methane.

Oxygen only needs 2 friends. H2O = Water, yo.

Sodium drops an Electron, becomes positive. Chlorine picks it up and becomes negative.
Now they're attracted to each other - congrats, we've got salt.

Oxygen really likes its electrons. Oxygen doesn't share equally with the Hydrogen.
This makes the Oxygen a little more negative and the Hydrogens a little more positive.

Water is *Polar*, and does funny things because of it.

Hydrogens spin to point towards other oxygens. Water Molecules like to point to
each other. This causes stuff like surface tension.

## Covalent Bonds

Covalent = sharing

Non-Polar: Electrons shared equally.

Polar: One takes more electron than the other.

Electronegativity, aka Electron-stealing-ness, increases towards the top right
of the periodic table.

## Ionic Bonds

Electron clouds don't mix/share. This returns to NaCl, where the charge alone attracts them.

This causes NaCl to form some pretty cool repeating structures, aka crystals.
