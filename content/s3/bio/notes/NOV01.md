# More Genetics

## Incomplete Dominance

Normally, if a dominant gene is present, it is fully expressed.

In Incomplete dominance, a dominant with a recessive only produces 50% of the dominant protein.

Genotype | Phenotype
---|---
HH | Normal LDL receptors
Hh | Half as many receptors
hh | Severe disease

## Multi-Allele

Blood type alleles can be A, B, or O.

Each allele produces it's own proteins. If A is present at all,

Genotype | Phenotype
---|---
AA | A
AO | A
AB | AB
BB | B
BO | B
OO | O

## pleiotropy

One gene can have multiple down-stream effects.

A single base pair change activates sickle cell, which has all kinds of effects.
