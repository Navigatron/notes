- 2 Homeworks due 9/9
- Project part 1 due 9/11
- exam 9/18

## Project part 1 - "Annotated Bibliography"

Bibliography with a paragraph per entry.

Paragraph tells:  
- Summary of the Source
- Why the Source is a good source

```
Citation. There's a bunch of stuff in here, and
	extra lines are indented. Following the
	citation, there's some whitespace.

	Annotation should be 150->200 words. This
	is a summary in my own words. This is
	not an abstract. Include the main argument
	and important points. Also includes the
	strengths of the article - why it is
	relevant to my topic.
```

Need 3 "primary literature references."  
- Published
- peer-reviewed

Rubric is on MyCourses

## Review - Bonds

- Ionic
	- Electrons are transferred
	- atoms are now charged
	- charged atoms attract each other
- Covalent
	- non-polar
		- shared electrons shared equally
	- polar
		- shared electrons hoarded by one party
- Hydrogen
	- Slight positive charge of Hydrogen when it's bonded to something else.

## Free Radicals

Atoms with incomplete valence shells.

UV Radiation, Campfires, other things, knock an electron off an atom, creating a "free radical".

They want their electrons back. They steal them from other places. This scars artery walls and damages dna.

Anti-Oxidants battle free-radicals. Fish, Chocolate, Salad, yumyum.

Anti-Oxidants provide free electrons for free-radicals to steal, so they don't attack other things.

## Water, yo

- 71% of earths surface
- 66% of a human's body weight
- For over 1 billion years, all life was aquatic

#### Important Properties:

- Cohesion, aka surface tension
- High specific heat
	- Regulates the temp of the *planet*, on the daily.
- Less dense when solid
- "Master Solvent"
- Hydrophilic interactions
	- Salt
	- Coffee
- Hydrophobic interactions
	- Oil

#### more definitions

- Cohesion: Water sticks to itself
- Adhesion: Water sticks to other things
	- Hydrogen bonding to the inside of capillaries

#### Prof makes homemade brandy

1. boil 3 gallons of water (sterilize)
2. Wait for it to cool down to 100 degrees to add yeast
	- This takes 7 hours

Ah, water has a high specific heat. (Fun fact, olive oil's specific heat is twice water's.)

#### Ice is less dense

Hydrogen bonds in liquid are chillin', sliding all around.

When water freezes, things stop moving. Hydrogen bonds stabilize, crystals form. Stable, crystal hydrogen bonds are longer.

Result: Ice floats.

Algae grows on the underside of ice. Shrimp eat that. Fish eat those. Seals eat those. Polar bears eat those. It's a whole ecosystem.

## Dissolve

term | meaning
--- | ---
solvent | Thing that dissolves other things
solute | Thing that dissolves in the solvent
aqueous solution | Solution where water is the solvent

#### Dissolving Salt (NaCl)

Sodium and Chlorine are very bad. In NaCl, they stabilize. Water then tears the NaCl apart into Na+ and Cl-, which are perfectly fine.

#### Dissolving hydrophobics

This doesn't happen, sorry.

## Next time: Chapter 3: Molecules.
