# Aerobic Cellular respiration

1. Glycolysis
	- Separate one Glucose into two 3-carbon chains called pyruvate
	- Doesn't require mitochondria or oxygen
	- Takes 2 ATP, makes 4, net gain of 2.
	- Occurs in cytosol
	- Reactants:
		- 1 glucose
		- 2 ATP
		- 1 Hexokinase
		- 4 ADP
		- 4 phosphates
		- 2 NAD+
		- 2 Hydrogen
	- Products:
		- 2 Pyruvate
		- 4 ATP
		- 2 NADH
2. PDC / Pyruvate Oxidation
	- pyruvate -> Acetyl-CoA + CO2
	- aka 3 carbon chain to 2 carbon chain
	- Reactants:
		- 2 pyruvate
		- 2 [CoA]
			- What is CoA? Good question.
		- 2 NAD+ + 2 Hydrogen
	- Products:
		- 2 Acetyl-CoA
		- 2 NADH
3. Citric Acid Cycle
	- Main goal here is to generate a heckton of electron carriers
	- Happens in the Mitochondria
	- The reaction described below is for one acetyl-CoA, remember each glucose creates two acetyl-CoA
	- Reactants:
		- ADP + Phosphate
		- NAD+ + Hydrogen
		- FAD+ + Hydrogen
		- Acetyl-CoA
	- Products:
		- 1 ATP
		- 3 NADH
		- 1 FADH2
		- 2 CO2
4. Electron Transport Chain (etc) and chemiosmosis
	- Goal: Use electrons to get Hydrogen between inner and outer mitochondria membranes.
	- Hydrogen buildup escapes by powering ATP-synthase, makes a bunch o' ATP
	- The electrons get on Oxygen, which then forms H2O

X|Glycolysis|PDC|Citric Acid Cycle|Oxidative Phosphorylation
---|---
Location | Cytoplasm | Mito Outer Membrane | Mitochondira | Inner Mito Membrane
Materials | Glucose(6C), 2ATP, NAD+, ADP+P, Hexokinase | 2 pyruvate, CoA, NAD+ + Hydrogen, Oxygen | 2acetylCoA, NAD+H, FAD+H, ADP+P | NADH, FADH2, O2
Products | 2 pyruvate, 2NADH, 4ATP | NADH, 2Acetyl-CoA, 2Co2 | 4CO2, 6NADH, 2FADH2, 2ATP | ATP, H2O, Nad+, Fad+
net ATP yield | 2 | 0 | 2 | 28-32
Electron Acceptor | NAD+ | NAD+ | NAD+ and FAD+	| Oxygen!

# Anaerobic Cellular Respiration

Backup ATP production. Less efficient, but always works.

Glycolysis step is the same

# Fun Facts!

- Obligate anaerobes
	- Poisoned by Oxygen
- Facultative anaerobes
	- Yeast and a bunch of bacteria
	- Changing yeast O2 supply changes their behavior.
