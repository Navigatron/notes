# Cell Division

## Prokaryotes

Binary Fission - literally dividing in half. Grow, split, grow, split. Some prokaryotes go through a cycle (grow, split) every 20 minutes.

- 3 stage of splitting
	1. Duplication of Chromosome, separation of copies
	2. Elongation of the cell, separating internals,
	3. Division into two daughter cells.

## Eukaryotes

Much more complicated

1. Duplicate Chromosomes into "sister chromatids"
2. Sep the sister chromatids into two chromosomes
3. Put em at opposite ends of the cell.
