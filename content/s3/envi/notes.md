## What is concrete made of?

[Concrete Construction.net - What concrete is made of](https://www.concreteconstruction.net/how-to/what-concrete-is-made-of_o)

Concrete is made of:
- Coarse aggregate, usually Gravel
- Fine aggregate, usually Sand
- Water
- Portland Cement

## What is Portland cement made of?

[Cement Production Emissions, by the Earth Institute at Columbia University](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/05/09/emissions-from-the-cement-industry/)

- Limestone and Clay are heated to create Clinker
- Clinker and gypsum are combined to make cement

- Producing one ton of cement:
	- requires 4.7 million BTU
		- 400 lbs of coal equivalent
	- Produces 1 ton of CO2

- When limestone is heated, it undergoes calcination
	- Calcium carbonate Breaks down into calcium oxide and CO2.
	- This accounts for 50% of the cement industries CO2.

- Heating kilns to 1400C accounts for 40% of the cement industries CO2.
	- The remaining 10% comes from vehicles, machinery, electricity for lights, and other such sources.

## More background info on the chemical process

[Royal Society of Chemistry - Calcium Carbonate Calcination](http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/resource/res00000704/thermal-decomposition-of-calcium-carbonate?cmpid=CMP00005970)

- Calcium carbonate breaks down into Calcium Oxide and Carbon Dioxide
	- (CaCO3 + Heat -> CaO + CO2)

## The Cement Manufacturing process from Illinois.edu

[Cement Production](http://matse1.matse.illinois.edu/concrete/prin.html)

- Limestone, Clay / Shale, Sand, and Iron Ore go into the kiln together
- "Clinker" comes out of the kiln
- Small amounts of gypsum are added to regulate setting
- The final product, Ground clinker + gypsum, is Portland Cement.
- Mixing water with portland cement causes the cement to bind together aggregate
	- This is a chemical reaction, concrete does not need to dry
- By weight, Portland cement is roughly:
	- 50% Tricalcium Silicate
		- Which provides most of the strength in the first 7 days of curing
	- 25% Dicalcium Silicate
		- Which cures much more slowly, but is much stronger
- Hydration Formula (Direct Quote)

```
Tricalcium silicate + Water ---> Calcium silicate hydrate+Calcium hydroxide + heat

2 Ca3SiO5 + 7 H2O ---> 3 CaO.2SiO2.4H2O + 3 Ca(OH)2 + 173.6kJ
```

- Calcium Silicate Hydrate crystals begin forming on the aggregate, and continue
to grow until all liquid areas have been replaced and the mixture is solid.

## Side note

The article from Illinois.edu mentions SuperPlasticizers - My mother works in the
concrete industry, and describes "Super-P" as a "soapy, slippery substance" that
replaces water and greatly increases the strength of concrete.

From [here](http://www.buildingresearch.com.np/newfeatures.php),
Super plasticizers can make up 0.5% to 3% of concrete by weight, and eliminate
the need for up to 40% of water.

I'm finding no hard information relating super-plasticizer additives to
human health after a quick search, though this will be an interesting topic to
pursue later.

## Conclusion so far

Limestone (Calcium Carbonate) from the ground is separated into an ingredient for cement
and CO2.

## How much CO2 does this produce?

[CO2 Emissions profile of the US Cement Industry](https://www3.epa.gov/ttnchie1/conference/ei13/ghg/hanle.pdf)

The above article provides lots of information.

- In the year 2000
	- "Global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from cement production were approximately
	829 million metric tons of CO2"
- In 2001, Coal accounted for 71% of the energy used by cement production in the US

## What are the alternatives?

[us-concrete.com](https://www.us-concrete.com/sustainability/ef-technology/)

The above website is a concrete supplier, and does not cite any sources for the
information they present. Below, I present more sources that back up these claims.

### Fly Ash

- Fly ash is a byproduct of coal-burning electric generating stations
- Fly ash used to be disposed of in landfills
- Fly ash can replace up to 50% of the Portland cement in concrete
- Fly ash concrete produces less heat when curing, which is very beneficial when
building large structures.

### Slag

- Impurities removed from melting metal
- Can replace up to 50% of Portland cement

Combined, Slag and Fly ash can replace up to 80% of the Portland cement in concrete

## More sources for the above

[Optimizing Fly Ash](https://www.cement.org/docs/default-source/fc_concrete_technology/is548-optimizing-the-use-of-fly-ash-concrete.pdf)

The Portland Cement Association released the above publication, detailing
the exact amounts of Fly ash to use when aiming for a certain goal.

[What Is Slag Cement?](https://www.slagcement.org/aboutslagcement/whatisslagcement.aspx)

Similar to the Portland Cement Association, there is a Slag Cement Association,
which confirms the data above.

## Conclusion

The cement industry produces 5% of humanities CO2 emissions. Up to 80% of cement
can be replaced by Fly ash and Slag, which are wastes of other industries
(Energy and Metallurgy respectively) that would otherwise end in a landfill.

In addition to reducing CO2 emissions, Making cement with fly ash and slag
results in stronger, more durable, more chemically resistant concrete.
