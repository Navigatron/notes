# Housekeeping

- Need to have read through chapter 8 in Living downstream
- Need to catch-up on... lots of things
- 2 essays due by the end of the month.

> Note: In the book report, use the two books as resources for a separate argument

# Environmental Disease Day One

*What are mutations?*

mutagen - increases rate of genetic change

teratogen - substances that cause harm to a growing embryo or fetus

carcinogen - something that causes cancer

about 2% of cancers are genetic - there are strong environmental ties.

mutations in somatic cells are not inherited - mutations in germ cells are passed directly to future generations.

Point mutations
	- Simple Substitution, T->C
	- Addition - drop another one in there - caused a frame shift, because codons are read in groups of 3.
	- Deletion - also causes a fame shift

> Note - December 4th - Frame shifts are pretty remarkable. Codons in DNA are read in groups of 3, and
each one becomes an amino acid in a protein. Take this: "CAT YES GOO BRO DOG", and frame shift it.
"ATY ESG OOB ROD OGC" - that makes no sense. Worse yet, this disrupts start and stop codons, which basically wreck
the mRNA transcription process. In short, a frame shift pretty much disables the creation of whatever protein this
part of the DNA was for. For more on pre-mRNA, I built [This](https://navigatron.github.io/nowaymrna/) for Bio 101.

## Translocation

when some DNA exchanges a piece with another bit of DNA.

## non-disjunction

chomosomes don't separate perfectly during cell division - one cell has an extra, and one cell has one missing.
