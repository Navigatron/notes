# Bamboo

## What is Bamboo?

Bamboo is a plant that grows tall and fast - but what else?

[Encyclopedia Britannica - Bamboo](https://www.britannica.com/plant/bamboo)

- Bamboo is a tree-like grass, comprising of 1400+ species
- Typically found in tropical to mild temperate regions
- More heavily concentrated in East and Southeast Asia
- Some species grow up to 1 foot per day
- Stems, or *culms*, range from 4cm to 40m

## Can bamboo absorb CO2?

[Ecology.com - Bamboo and CO2](http://www.ecology.com/2013/05/15/what-can-bamboo-do-about-co2/)

- Bamboo is better at removing CO2 from the atmosphere than trees.
	- While smaller, it grows much faster.
- One hectare of Moso bamboo can remove 5.1 tons of carbon
- Bamboo can be used as a building material
- Bamboo's root system re-grows culms as soon as they are harvested

## Carbon -> Bamboo, then what?

The above article hints that bamboo can be used as a building material, replacing
building materials that may be less environmentally friendly.

## Bamboo Structures and Physical strength

[Newsweek - Bamboo](https://www.newsweek.com/stronger-steel-85533)

- Bamboo has a greater tensile strength than steel
- And greater compressive strength than concrete
- Bamboo makes higher quality plywood
- Bamboo produces 35% more O2 from CO2 than trees
- Bamboo's root system is better at stabilizing soil than trees
	- This reduces erosion

## Bamboo as a building material

[Bamboo as Building Material](https://theconstructor.org/building/bamboo-as-a-building-material-uses-advantages/14838/)

- Bamboo must be dried, boiled, or chemically treated to avoid rot
- Bamboo quickly degrades when in prolonged contact with moisture
- Bamboo joinery is difficult, with questionable structural reliability
- Bamboo shrinks more than any other timber as it looses water
- Despite this, bamboo remains a very popular building material in the areas
where it is very common
	- It is unlikely to replace concrete or steel in significant amounts in the US

## Bamboo pulp for paper

[EPA pulp and paper CO2 emissions](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/ghgrp-pulp-and-paper)

- The pulp and paper industry released between 20 and 30 million metric tons of CO2
in 2017
- It is unclear weather using bamboo pulp would decrease CO2 emissions over
other organic matter

## Conclusions so far:

- Bamboo absorbs more CO2 from the air than trees
- In the eastern hemisphere, bamboo is used for rural construction
- In the western hemisphere, It is unclear what bamboo may be used for
	- While more environmentally friendly, it has disadvantages in terms of
	durability and stability when compared to concrete or steel
	- Use for paper production is also unlikely.

## A closer look at carbon absorbtion

[Phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2017-06-trees-bamboos-halves-carbon-storage.html)

Phys.org cites the following:

```
Zaninovich S.C, L.F. Montti, M.F. Alvarez, M.G. Gatti. 2017. Replacing trees by
	bamboos: Changes from canopy to soil organic carbon storage. Forest Ecology
	and Management 400: 208-217. DOI: 10.1016/j.foreco.2017.05.047
```

- Bamboo produces lower-quality leaf litter than trees, resulting in increased
leaf-littler-layer depth.
	- Decomposers have a more difficult time decomposing bamboo leaf litter
	- The leaf litter layer can double in depth
- "The soil contains more carbon than the atmosphere and the vegetation"
- Leaf litter prevents soil from absorbing carbon

## Conclusion

Bamboo forests can absorb more CO2 than regular forests, however, CO2 storage
capacity is decreased due to the difficulty with which bamboo leaf litter
is decomposed.

Bamboo is not likely to replace modern products, and will not improve CO2
sequestering of existing forests.

However, bamboo is significantly better than nothing, and will vastly
improve CO2 absorbtion of hostile environments, such as rocky terrain or
other areas where plant life is scarce.
