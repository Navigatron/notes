Risk is impact * probability.

A Risk Management Process is a process by which you determine and measure your risks.

NIST CSF ID.RM-2: Determine and Express your risk tolerance.

> I do not believe in risk tolerances.

ID.RM-3: Base the Risk Tolerance on information.

There's also this thing called the NIST RMF: Risk Management Framework.

- Prepare the organization
- Categorize systems and information by business impact
- Select controls
- Implement the controls
- Assess the controls - are they effective?
- Authorize the system to operate, now that it's defended
- Monitor the system

Things to think about:

- How important is is that data X remains secret?
	- How many customers will we lose?
	- How much of our competitive edge will we lose?
- Availability obligations
	- How many $/min do we lose from the system going down?
- Compliance obligations
	- How expensive will the HIPAA fines be?

HILF Risks - High Impact, Low Frequency - These risks can destroy an organization. This is where business continuity and disaster recovery come in.
