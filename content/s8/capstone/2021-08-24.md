# Capstone one: the first one

It's Syllabus day!

There is a quiz each week, and each one is 1% of the final grade.

Teams are assigned, and projects are assigned to each team.

Join Slack. Each team will receive their own private channel.

Deliverables:

Item | Due in
---|---
Progress Report | Week 4
Project Report Draft #1 | Week 6
Progress Report 2, draft Poster | Week 10
Project Report Draft 2 | Week 12
final poster | Week 13
project report | Week 15

Each of these items is accompanied by a peer review - an evaluation of your peers and yourself. The four peer review categories are:

- Workload
    - Takes on
- Timeliness
- Respect
- Activeness
    - Present for discussions, participates

There is an "Outstanding Capstone" award up for grabs.
