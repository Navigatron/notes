## Domain Driven Design

> "Domain Driven Design centers the architecture on the problem domain."

The application layer holds application-wide things, like the logging entity, and other infrastructure. "Try to keep the app layer as light as possible".

The model layer has:

- Entity objects
    - Must have some unique ID field
- Value objects
    - Dates, credit card numbers, X/Y coordinates
    - Not just a data holder
    - Comparison based on field values, not object handles

Model layer things may need custom `equals` and `hashCode` methods.

HTTP requests hit controllers, which use services, delegate to entities, and serve FTL files.

## State Based Behavior

State describes kinda how your models work, the relationships between these components. We put it in a state chart, which is a kind of uml diagram.

A solid ball represents the starting state. Arrows show where a state may transition to another state.

Transitions have labels, which tell you three things:

- The *Event*
    - What triggers this transition
- The *Guard*
    - What criteria must be matched to continue
- The *Action*
    - Something that happens during the transition

```
event [guard] / action
```

If a state has many transitions out, on the same trigger, then the guards of those transitions should be mutually exclusive. Guards should have no side effects.
