The *Class Model* defines the static structure of your implementation

Dynamic behavior is captured by state models.

Write code for humans. Clear communication includes:

- Shared code style
- Tabs vs Spaces
- knowing where braces go
- Naming conventions
    - CamelCase
    - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
    - lowerCamelCase
- Making names clear
    - Names reflect purpose
    - Method names describe *what*, not *how*
    - Don't abbreviate names
    - avoid "not" in names. `isValid` vs `isNotValid`
- Documentation
    - Javadocs use `/***/` comments
    - Document all public members of a class
    - Inline comments help guide the reader
    - Use `//TODO` and `//FIXME` where appropriate
