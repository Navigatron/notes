## Design Documentation

Design docs are a way to describe what we've built, and why we've built it that way.

It should:

- Be short
- Be easy to read
- Communicate design decisions
- Justify those decisions
- Move from high to low level

> "Figures figures figures" - prof

Recommended design doc structure:

- Exec summary
    - Purpose
    - Glossary and Acronyms
- Requirements
    - Def of MVP
    - MVP Features
    - Roadmap of Enhancements
- Application Domain
    - Overview of major Domain Areas
    - Domain area detail
- Application Architecture
    - Summary
    - overview of UI
    - Tier Designs
        - Summary
        - Static models
        - Dynamic Models

Use short, declarative statements in the active voice.

Other things that could be documented:

- Setup guide
- UI and UX design and style guides
- Acceptance tests
- help docs
- training docs

Design doc updates are now part of the "definition of done".

## Code Coverage

Code coverage is a metric of how well your unit tests exercise the production code - what parts do they or don't they touch?

- Compile the code into bytecode
- Saturate the bytecode with "touch points"
- Run the unit tests, see which touch points it hits

We will use something called "JaCoCo". It generates html reports.

Prof recommends 95% coverage for model classes, and 80% or better in UI and other tiers.
