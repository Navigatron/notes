We live in an imperfect world, with plenty of problems. Some of these problems are more impactful than others.

Public policy is made in response to a problem. It's oriented to some goal.

We often find disagreement in exactly what problem may be, its causes, or how to *best* fix it.

Birkland argues that there are four fundamental goals:

- Equity
- Efficiency
- Security
- Liberty

A policy is not guaranteed to be *effective* at working towards its goal.

Policies often have broad scopes - they're said to be "in the public's interest".

Policy is made by governments, and enforced by governments.

> "Policy is what the government chooses to do or not to do."
