# PUBL 101: Intro to Public Policy

This course is/was async, so each file is my notes for that week.

Since I've taken many high-level PUBL classes before this one - these notes are a little short / sparse.

{% assign parenturl = page.url | remove:'/index.html' %}
{% for sibling in site.pages %}
{% if sibling.url contains parenturl %}
{% unless sibling.url == page.url %}
[{{ sibling.date }}: {{ sibling.title }}]({{ sibling.url | relative_url }})
{% endunless %}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Deviations
