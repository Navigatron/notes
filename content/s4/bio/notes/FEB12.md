## Blue Book Question

> Today, FEB12 is special for three reasons. Write down one of the reasons.

# Chapter 23 Continued

Leptin is a hormone released by adipose cells that limits appetite.

A correlation has been found between obesity and a mutant, ineffective form of leptin.

A Harvard study found that weight loss is tied to calories more than protein/fat/carb composition.

# Chapter 24 - The Immune System

- Innate Immunity
- Adaptive Immunity
- Disorders or the Immune System

## Innate Immunity

> Innate: Instinctual, Automatic, Born with it

- Nearly everything is teeming with pathogens
    - Pathogens are agents that cause disease
- Immune system protects against pathogens
- Innate Immunity
    - Response is the same weather or not the pathogen has been previously encountered.
    - Acts immediately upon infection
- Invertebrates
    - rely on innate immunity only
    - Exoskeleton or other physical barrier
    - low pH and lysozyme
        - "special enzyme"
        - attacks anything that shouldn't be there
    - Immune cells capable of phagocytosis
- Overview of vertebrate innate immunity
    - Rapid Response
    - recognizes broad range of pathogens
- Primary innate response
    - Barriers
        - Epithelium
            - Keratin coating, protective hair.
            - Resists abrasion and pathogen entry
        - Glandular secretions
            - Flush microorganisms and chemicals from skin surface
            - Chemicals and enzymes (like lysozyme) in tears and saliva inhibit some microorganisms
        - Internal epithelia
            - Protected by mucus, stomach acid.
- Secondary Innate response

Quick break for blue-book #3 - Where are stem cells produced?

- Secondary Innate Response
    - Phagocytes
        - Non-specific, go after everything the same
        - White blood cells that ingest particles, cell pieces, whole cells
        - Microphages
            - neutrophils and eosinophils
            - normally in blood but can leave to enter tissue
        - Macrophages
            - Slide changed, didn't catch this bit
    - Inflammation
        - Locallized tissue response to injury with redness, swelling, heat, pain
        - Triggered by damage to loose connective tissue or cell death
        - Sequence of Events
            - Damage occurs, bacteria past the epidermis
            - Mast cells and macrophages release signaling molecules (histamines)
            - Capillaries widen, neutrophils migrate to area
    - Widespread inflammation
        - If something gets into the blood stream and spreads
        - Too much results in septic shock
    - Fever
        - Continued elevation of body temp above 99degF
        - Triggered by macrophages, pathogens, the usual suspects
        - Beneficial within limits
            - It'll kill pathogens
            - Above 104degF, can damage tissues or organs
- Tertiary Innate Response
    - Natural Killer cells (NK cells), Lymphocytes, Others
        - Recognize and destroy cells bearing abnormal antigens
        - Always sneaking around
    - Interferons
        - Small protein released by activated lymphocytes, macrophages, infected cells
        - Cause normal cells to produce antiviral compounds
        - May stimulate NK cells into action

## Adaptive Immunity

- Can also be called acquired or learned immunity
- Develops after body has seen a pathogen
- Found only in vertebrates
- Differs from individual to individual
    - Depending on what you have been exposed to
- Typically only triggers if innate does not work
- Slower response
- Recognizes specific things
- Has "Memory"
- Targets things based on memory
- Antigens
    - Any molecule that elicits an adaptive immune response
    - Foreign molecule recognized by our immune system
    - Viruses, bacteria, mold, spores, pollen, dust
