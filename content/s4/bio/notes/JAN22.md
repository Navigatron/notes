## Mechanisms of Gas Exchange

- Gas exchange relies on the respiratory and circulatory systems
- Three phases of gas exchange in Humans and other lunged things
    1. Breathing (ventilation)
    2. Transport (circulation)
    3. Exchange with cells (cellular respiration)
- respiratory surfaces
    - The part of the body where gas exchange occurs with the environment
    - Gotta be moist, for diffusion
    - Gotta be thin, so gasses can go through
- Diffusion through the skin:
    - Traditionally in smaller animals
        - Don't need much
    - Traditionally in moist or aquatic environments
        - Best environment for diffusion
- Gills
    - Aquatic places
    - Water flows into fish mouth, exits via gills
- Tracheal Systems
    - insects
    - openings to a lot of tubes
    - reduced water loss
    - Circulatory system not involved
    - O2 delivered directly to cells
    - Large insects move / muscle contraction to move air
    - In some insects, the act of flying also rapidly pumps air through the system
- Lungs
    - mammals, reptiles, terrestrial vertebrates
    - Amphibians
        - Tiny lungs, still use skin
    - Non-bird reptiles
        - Simple lungs
    - Birds and Mammals
        - High metabolic rate
        - Complex lungs
    - Birds are special
        - Air sacs in addition to lungs
        - "Unidirectional flow"
            - Down one tube, through air sacs, out the other one
- Respiration vs Ventilation
    - Respiration is "respiratory exchange", it's what cells do
    - Ventilation is moving gasses in and out, it's what lungs do
- Water has 3% of the O_2 of air
    - Cold water holds more O2
    - Fresh water holds more O2
    - Turbulent water holds more O2
- Air
    - Has lots more O2 than water
    - is a lot easier to move, it's lighter

## The Mammalian (Human) Respiratory System

- Air primarily moves in via the nose
    - Filtered by hairs and mucous surfaces
    - Warmed and humidified
    - detect smells
- pharynx
- larynx
- Trachea
    - Made of cartilage, always open
    - Splits in two, into the...
- Bronchai
    - It's a tree structure
- bronchioles
- alveoli
    - Like a bunch of hollow grapes
    - expand and contract with breathing
    - One cell thick, gas diffuses through here
    - Looks like they're in a net, that's blood vessels

- Surfactants
    - Keeps alvioli from sticking shut due to moisture surface tension
- Respiratory Distress Syndrome
    - babies born 6+ weeks early do not have much surfactant
    - Artificial surfactant now administered
- Surfactant damage
    - pollutants
    - cigarette smoke
    - Limits surfactant production and gas exchange
    - extreme cases, COPD
        - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
- Breathing
    - "Negative Pressure Ventilation"
    - Diaphragm pulls down, lowering pressure in the lungs
    - Atmosphere pushes its way in, pressure equalizes
    - Diaphragm pushes, increases pressure
    - air rushes out
    - rinse, wash, repeat as needed.

- Lung Capacity
