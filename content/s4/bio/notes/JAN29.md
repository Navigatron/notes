## The Cardiovascular System

### Blood - Heart Interaction

- Blood flows through veins, heading towards the heart
- Enters the landing area, the "atrium"
- Passes through a valve to the "ventricle"
    - This valve, separating the atrium and ventricle, is called an atrioventricular valve.
- The ventricle contracts, pushing blood out the semi-lunar valve and out on its way via veins.

### Two Circuits

Mammals operate on a "double-pump" or two-circuit system.

The above sequence happens twice, once on each side.

- Pulmonary circuit
    - Right side of heart -> Lungs
    - Gas Exchange takes place
    - Lungs -> Left side of heart
- Systemic circuit
    - Left side of heart -> Body
    - Oxygen is depleted
    - Body -> Right side of heart

### Big Words

- Vena Cava
    - Largest vein, entering right atrium
- Aorta
    - Largest artery, exiting left ventricle and heading downwards, becomes femoral arteries
- Tricuspid vs Bicuspid (don't need to know this)
    - Three flaps, two flaps - describes atrioventricular valves
- aortic and pulmonary also describes semi-lunar valves

### Cardiac Cycle

The heart contracts and relaxes in a rhythmic sequence; separately but simultaneously moving blood to the lungs and body.

There are two portions of this cycle

- Diastole
    - Dia, as in Dilate, as in relax - blood enters
    - AV valves open, blood fills atriums and ventricles
    - semilunar valves prevent backflow
- Systole
    - contract - blood leaves
    - AV valves close to prevent backflow
    - Ventricle contraction forces blood through semilunar valves into the body

### Electrical Events

- Nodes
    - Packs of nerves that send signals
- SA Node
    - "pacemaker" of the heart, this is the clock
    - Located on atrium
- AV Node
    - atrioventricular node
    - Introduces delay, sends signal to apex

1. Signal from SA node spread through atria
2. AV node triggered. AV node waits, then sends to apex
3. Apex triggers the spike in the ecg, ventricles contract.

### LUB.DUB

- Lub
    - AV valves closing, prepare for push
- Dub
    - Push complete, semi-lunar valves closing

### Measuring

- Cardiac Output
    - Volume of blood each ventricle pumps per minute
- Heart Rate
    - Number of beats per minute

## Structure and Function of Blood Vessels

### What are they made of

The walls of blood vessels ("arterial and venous walls") are made of three layers:

- Endothelium
    - Inner lining of endothelial cells
- Middle Layer
    - Smooth Muscle Tissue
    - "vasoconstriction" - narrow diameter - contraction
    - "vasodilation" - wider diameter - relaxation
- Stabilizing Sheath
    - Connective Tissue

The veins and the arteries are different

- veins
    - Internal valves prevent backflow
    - "passive movement" - far away from pump, low pressure flow
    - Smaller smooth muscle layer
    - Fed from many "venules", small veins
- Arteries
    - No internal valves
    - Super Thick smooth muscle
        - Large changes in pressure and diameter due to pump proximity
- Capillary Bed
    - Epithelium and basal layer, not much more than that.
    - being super thin + basal layer allows highly efficient gas/nutrient exchange
    - Capillaries are about as wide as a single RBC
    - Surrounded by interstitial fluid
        - exchanges many molecules through both diffusion and osmosis

### Capillary Control

- pere-capillary sphincters
    - Open or close to allow flow to capillary networks

### Blood pressure and velocity

- Blood pressure
    - Force on vessel walls
    - depends on cardiac output and resistance of vessels to expansion
    - decreases as blood moves away from the heart
    - High in arteries, low in veins
    - Measured by:
        - Systolic pressure
            - Highest point during ventricular contraction (systolic phase)
        - diastolic pressure
            - Lowest point during diastolic phase

Blood pressure contributes to fluid exchange

- Higher pressure on arterial side pushes fluid out
- Osmotic pressure on venous side brings fluid in

Skeletal muscle provides dynamic pressure on veins, helping move blood against gravity.

## Blood

### Fun Facts

- avg adult has 4 to 6 liters
- Temp: ~38C
- pH: 7.4 (Pretty darn neutral)
- 5x more viscous that water
- 55% plasma
- 45% stuff

### Plasma

- 90% water
- 10% proteins and dissolved material
- Seeps out into tissues, becoming interstitial fluid
- RBCs carry O2, plasma carries everything else
- Proteins
    - Albumins
        - ~60% of plasma Proteins
        - Transports hormones and fatty acids
    - Fibrinogen
        - Clotting
    - Globulins
        - ~35%
        - Two types
            - Immunoglobulins (antibodies)
            - Transport Proteins (lipoproteins) for ions, hormons, other stuff.
- Other dissolved stuff
    - Electrolytes
        - Na+, Cl-, K+, Ca(2+), etc.
    - organic nutrients
        - glucose, fatty acids, amino acids
    - Organic wastes
        - urea from liver, to be filtered by kidneys

### Blood Cells

- Red (RBCs)
    - roughly 33% of all cells in body
    - Contain hemoglobin
        - contains iron for O2 binding
    - No nucleus
    - Cannot self repair, live for 120 days max
    - body produces 180 million per minute
- White (Leukocytes [WBCs])
    - Not a ton of these
    - Mostly in tissue
    - produced in bone marrow
    - have nuclei
    - Move on their own
    - ooze out of capillaries to patrol tissues"
    - literally eat evil things
- Thrombocytes (Platelets)
    - enzyme-bearing packets that break away from producing cells in bone marrow
    - no nucleus
    - live around 10 days max
    - Clump together at injury sites to prevent blood loss
