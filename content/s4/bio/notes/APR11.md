# Bio II Lecture, April 11th

- 1 week to fill out presentation availability form

## Community structure and dynamics

> Note card 1: Autotrophic organisms convert what form of energy to another form of energy?

- producers
- consumers
- Detritovores
	- Derive energy from detritus, dead material from all trophic levels.
- Decomposers
	- secrete enzymes that digest organic material into inorganic material

A food web is more realistic than a food chain.

- species diversity
	- richness
		- a species is "rich" if there is a lot of it in an area
	- abundance
		- How many different species are in an area

&nbsp;

- batsian mimicry
	- viceroy and monarch butterflies look very similar
	- one is toxic, the other mimics for protection
- Mullerian mimicry
	- poison dart frogs
	- all are toxic

## Ecosystem structure and dynamics

now taking into account, abiotic factors.

> Notecard 3: Bacteria, Protists and fungi are traditionally recieving their energy from which trophic level(s)?

> Notecard 3 - Nitrogen is the most common essential element to be deficient in plants. Hance, why it is the main ingredient in most fertilizers. [True/false]

## The scientific study of behavior

behavior associated with organisms with a nervous system
