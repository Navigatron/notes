## Chapter 33

- Plant hormons - [last class](./MAR26.md)
- Responses to Stimuli

### Responses to Stimuli

Long and short day plants will flower when days are long and short, respectively. Specifically, short day plants flower when exposed to a long period of contiguous darkness. Long day plants flower in the absence of long periods of contiguous darkness.

Defense Mechanisms

- Physical Defenses
	- thorns, spines, needles
- Chemical Defenses
	- Nasty flavor, toxic compounds

No no Mr. Caterpillar

- Caterpillar finds itself on a leaf - yay!
- Caterpillar goes to town, munchin' away, havin' a ball
- Red alert sirens going off in the plant
- Defense activated: wasp attractant
- Wasp attractant dissipates from the plant
- Wasps are drawn to the plant
- Wasps kill, eat, and lay eggs in, the Caterpillar.

No no Mr. Microbe

- Primary defense
	- Waxy epidermis layer - difficult for microbes to get through
- Secondary defense
	- damaged cells signal to start chemical defense
	- she changed the slide, probably releases anti-microbe chemicals I guess

## End chapter 33

## Chapter 34 - The Biosphere: An Introduction to the Earth's Diverse Environments

- The Biosphere
- Aquatic Biomes
- Terrestrial Biomes

### The Biosphere

Ecology - The scientific study of the interactions of organisms with their environments

Members of an ecosystem

- Producers
	- Autotrophs
	- convert inorganic stuff/energy to organic stuff.
- Consumers
	- Heterotrophs
	- Eat producers
- Decomposers and Detritovores
	- Convert waste back to inorganic material.

Biosphere

- All of earth that is inhabited by life.
