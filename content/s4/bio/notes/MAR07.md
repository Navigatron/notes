### Plant structure and Function

- Gymnosperms
    - Pine trees
    - "naked seed bearing"
- Angiosperms
    - "Seed is contained in a vessel"
    - 90% of plants
    - Monocots
        - long, thin leaves
        - leaves have direct attachment to stem
        - "veins" run from base to tip of leaf, parallel
        - root system is an explosion from a single point ("Fibrous root system")
        - Could have a "prop root", another root to hold it up.
        - asymmetrical seed - "one cotyledon"
    - Eudicots
        - Big, Broad leaves.
        - intermedial stem (petiole) connects leaf to stem
        - Primary *tap root*, goes down, other roots come off this.
        - Symmetrical seed - "Two cotyledons"
- Plant bodies
    - Generally three organs and two organ systems
        - above ground and below ground
        - stem, leaves, roots.
- Roots
    - below ground
    - store long term energy
    - anchors the plant to the ground
    - absorb water and minerals


> A short intermission - missing info here

- Parenchyma cells
    - thin, flexible cell wall
    - material enters and exits easily
- Collenchyma
    - No secondary wall
    - very thick exterior wall
    - flexible support in actively growing parts of the plant.
- sclerenchyma
    - Two specializations
    - Fibers
        - long, cylindrical
        - generally found in bundles
    - Sclereids
        - Shorter than fibers
        - Thick, very hard cell wall - nut shells, pear tissue
- Xylem

> Didn't catch xylem or the last one.

The notes for today are very incomplete. I fell asleep multiple times.
