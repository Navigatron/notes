# SysAdmin, FEB06 - Version Control

Version control is very important

## Diff and Patch

Diff records the differences between files.

Patch applies a diff file to re-create on of the two original files.

With this, one only needs to store the first version and the "deltas" that lead to the original state.

## More Systems

SCCS - Source Code Control System

RCS - Revision Control System. One person per file at a time

CVS - Concurrent Versioning System. Client server ish, still check out files.

Subversion - Branching, Tagging, bug fixes, pretty good.

**GOD KING** *TORVALDS* creates our salvation, ***GIT***.

- Highly distributed
- Anyone can work on anything at any time
- decentralized nature allows pushing/pulling parts of code to whoever needs it
- `git add * && git commit -m 'yeet' && git push`
