# Saurkraut

Buy the stuff in bags, that's cold. Jarred isn't as good.

Pour it, juice and all, into a big bowl. Fill with *cold* water, let sit.

Reach into the sauerkraut and grab a big 'ol handful. *Squeeze* all the water out. Make it Dry.

> Cooking it at this point results in dry, flavorless sauerkraut that will disappoint your friends.

Add flavor through spices: Idk which spices, but you need them. Juniper berries?

> Confirmed, Juniper berries are used to make gin, and are great in sauerkraut.

Add moisture through a 'tasty beer' or white wine.

Enhance flavors with onions.

Here's a good idea:

- Diced onion in a pan
- cooked to transparency, not browned
- then add the dry sauerkraut, spices and liquids to the same pan

It's done when it's hot, I guess. Goes good with pork or kielbasa.
