> This coffee has the full flavor spectrum. It's like adding a subwoofer to your home theater system. The texture is more oily than watery. Can def be a little bitter with overextraction, letting it sit for an hour makes it rough.

## Aeropress

> The coffee from the Aeropress doesn't have any bitterness at all, even when going pretty fine with the grind. Unfortunately it seems to lose other parts of the spectrum as well. But then again, I'm still playing with ratios.

	- 24g coffee, finer grind
	- 400g water (6g:100g ratio)
	- Mixed with 150g water, lost 25g in press
	- Tastes like a generic dark roast
	- I feel like the volume is low on some of the spectrum
	- Def has *some* acidity?
