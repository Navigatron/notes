Water capacities:

- French Press: 1000g
- French Press with stuff in it: 900g
- Large-ish mug: 400g (at max)

## French Press

> I really like this one

6g of coffee per 100g water

- 54g ground coffee
- 900g boiling water, added all at once
- Wait 4 minutes
- Scrape the crust off the top, stir
- Put the lid on, but do not plunge
- Wait 11 minutes
- Do not plunge

> This coffee has the full flavor spectrum. It's like adding a subwoofer to your home theater system. The texture is more oily than watery. Can def be a little bitter with overextraction, letting it sit for an hour makes it rough.

## Aeropress

> The aeropress is a little weird.

> The coffee from the Aeropress doesn't have any bitterness at all, even when going pretty fine with the grind. Unfortunately it seems to lose other parts of the spectrum as well. But then again, I'm still playing with ratios.

	- 24g coffee, finer grind
	- 400g water (6g:100g ratio)
	- Mixed with 150g water, lost 25g in press
	- Tastes like a generic dark roast
	- I feel like the volume is low on some of the spectrum
	- Def has *some* acidity?

## Pour Over

> Faster than the french press, imo better than the aeropress

- Put 1l (at least) of water on to boil
- Put the filter in the funnel
	- Add hot water, put on the fench press base
	- This rinses the paper, and pre-heats the press
- Grind 60g of coffee
- Put the coffee in the funnel
- Pour out the paper water from the base
- Pour 1: Bloom
	- Roughly 200g of water
	- Get the coffee wet
	- wait 5 seconds
- Pour 2
	- Get up to 600g of water
	- Pour slowly, over everything
	- Wait for it to draw down a bit
- Pour 3
	- Get up to 1000g of water
	- knock down the edges
	- optional: a little stir once the water's in
