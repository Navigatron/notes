# Dog Training

## Engagement

The dog should look to the owner for guidance and leadership.

- Make eye contact
- Make decisions for the dog: "We're walking this way now"

The goal is to create a *Relationship* with the dog. The owner should provide calm, consistent leadership for the dog.

A dog that's jumping up is showing engagement and excitement. While jumping isn't desirable, the excitement is. Jumping can be fixed very easily after the owner and the dog form a strong relationship.

### Exercise: Naming

- "Lure" the dog into making eye contact
- Say the dogs name
- Give a reward: lots of pets!
- repeat

Outcomes:

- The dog knows to pay attention when it hears its name

### Exercise: Reversing

- Walk with the dog in one direction
- At random, or when the dog gets a bit far away:
    - say "With me!"
    - switch direction
- Reward the dog for following: lots of pets!
- repeat

Outcomes:

- The dog knows to look to the owner for guidance
- The dog knows to follow along when it hears "With me!"
- The dog walks close to / next to the owner

## Behavior Enforcement

Short:

- Make the dog aware of some reward
    - pets and attention
    - food
    - a toy
- Ask the dog to perform some task
    - come
    - sit / down
- Provide the reward
