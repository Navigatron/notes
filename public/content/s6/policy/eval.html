<h1>Policy Evaluation</h1>
<ol>
<li>Identify Goals
<ul>
<li><em>Has the policy achieved its goals?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Understand how a policy works
<ul>
<li>We want to understand why a policy leads to the results that it does</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identify targeting population
<ul>
<li>Who is the policy intended to affect? Who does it affect?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Measure the outcome
<ul>
<li>&quot;Devise a means to measure the extend to which the goals have been achieved&quot;</li>
<li>Often involves <em>Counterfactuals</em> - What would have happened?</li>
<li>This is very very difficult.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decide on the criteria/value system
<ul>
<li>On what grounds will we evaluate the policy?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example: Fema + HMGP</h2>
<p>Fema's goal is to reduce losses from natural hazards.</p>
<p>The <em>Hazard Mitigation Grant Program</em> gives funds to state and local govs, after a disaster, to help mitigate future disasters. The HMGP could fund up to 75% of mitigation projects.</p>
<p><em>How can we evaluate the HMGP?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This can relate to business - how can a business measure the success of an internal program? Do pizza parties actually help morale?</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Goals - to reduce the losses from natural disasters.</li>
<li>Method - localities voluntarily propose projects for funding
<ul>
<li>Projects are area specific, no dams in the desert! Nice.</li>
<li>Voluntary participation means it might not be as effective as hoped.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Target Population - Areas where disasters can strike</li>
<li>Measuring the Outcomes
<ul>
<li>Projected losses from a disaster - actual losses = losses avoided. How to determine this?</li>
<li>Idea - Look at the decrease in insurance rates in the area?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
