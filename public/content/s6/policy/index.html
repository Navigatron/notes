<h1>Public Policy Analysis</h1>
<p>Policy is created in response to <em>problems</em>.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to agree on what is a problem, and which problem is the most important.</p>
<p>A snowstorm is not a problem by itself. A snowstorm is a <em>condition</em>. However, this condition can lead to problems, like more traffic accidents.</p>
<p>Four fundamental policy goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equity</li>
<li>Efficacy</li>
<li>something - prof changed slides too fast</li>
<li>Liberty</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Attributes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Problems</li>
<li>Goals</li>
<li>Public Interest</li>
<li>Made by Government</li>
<li>Action and Inaction</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pareto Efficiency</h2>
<p>In relation to the free market, Pareto Efficiency is the point where nobody can be made better off without making somebody else worse off. In this case, there is no <em>economic</em> need for government policy.</p>
<p>If we are <em>not</em> in Pareto efficiency, we can make somebody better off without making anyone else worse off - the market is not acting efficiently, and government policy <em>may</em> help.</p>
<h2>2020-09-10</h2>
<ul>
<li>leave your comments and thoughts in the discussion posts on myCourses</li>
<li>Go over the reading and post in the forum by EoD</li>
<li>There is a problemset that will be emerging at some point</li>
<li>ProblemSet answers due next Tuesday</li>
<li>Handwriting answers is acceptable??</li>
<li>But scanning to pdf is kinda nice</li>
<li>graded by effort</li>
</ul>
<p>Conditions for an efficient free market:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many buyers and sellers - price taken as given</li>
<li>identical products</li>
<li>no barrier to entry or exit</li>
<li>perfect information</li>
</ul>
<h1>What could create a market failure?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Externalities</li>
<li>Public Goods</li>
<li>Monopolies</li>
<li>Information Asymmetry</li>
</ul>
<p>Under a market failure, government intervention <em>may</em> be able to increase efficiency.</p>
<p>In a perfect market, there still <em>might</em> be regulation, towards the other 3 policy goals.</p>
<p>#What tools do we have to address social damage?</p>
<p><strong>Pigouvian Tax</strong> - A tax on each unit of good, equal to the social damage of that unit of good.</p>
<p><strong>Cap and Trade</strong> - In the context of pollution - the cap is the total amount of permitted pollution. Then, a license to polute is given to industry. Different industry players can trade their licenses, to allocate the permitted pollution via a free market.</p>
