<h1>2020-03-24</h1>
<p>This is actually the 15th, but I'm watching the videos from yesterday.</p>
<p>Homework 5 is due on March 31st.</p>
<p>Prof says there's 8 videos this week. That's 4 per class period.</p>
<h2>Video 1</h2>
<p>A well-formed ER diagram captures entities and relationships between them, and does not require much normalization (if any).</p>
<ul>
<li>Chen notation
<ul>
<li>The big graphs and diagrams</li>
<li>lots of detail</li>
<li>farther away from implementation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Crow's foot notation
<ul>
<li>It's a table with a header</li>
<li>no composite attributes</li>
<li>close to what will be implemented</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When we normalize conman, there's actually like 4 entities in there. The original ER diagram was doing too many different things.</p>
<p>When there are multiple entities, the entities may have relationships between them.</p>
<p>An <em>entitiy class</em> is an abstract thing. There may also be <em>entity instances</em>. For example, Jim may be an Employee.</p>
<h2>Video 2</h2>
<p>Relationship classes vs instances, degrees, has-a</p>
<p>A line between entities is an entity class. Every relationship must have a verb phrase. This describes the relationship.</p>
<p>For example, a department has an employee.</p>
<p>An employee is mentored by another employee. This is a <em>recursive</em> relationship.</p>
<p>An instance is an actual relationship between entity instances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cross-over model: When reading a relationship class, if the description has a <code>/</code> character, read only the second description encountered in the direction of travel. For example:<br>
Employee ---------- has many/assigned to ---------- Department<br>
read as 'employee assigned to department'<br>
OR 'department has many employees'<br>
This is completely absurd, but we might be tested on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>degree</em> of a relationship is how many entities participate in that relationship. A recursive employee-mentors-employee relationship has a degree of one. Employees in departments is a degree of 2.</p>
<p>A <em>binary</em> relationship is a relationship with a degree of two.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Degree</th>
<th>Name</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Recursive</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Binary</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It looks like, in chen notation, relationships are diamonds.</p>
<p>In crows foot, it's just a line between multiple tables.</p>
