<h1>Bio Lecture March 26th</h1>
<h2>Housekeeping</h2>
<ul>
<li>Exam 3 a week from today</li>
<li>Project part 3, &quot;Discussion Post&quot;, due by 11:59PM this Friday</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chapter 32</h2>
<ul>
<li>Uptake and Transport of Nutrients (last class)</li>
<li>Plant nutrients and the soil (last class)</li>
<li>Plant nutrition and symbiosis</li>
</ul>
<h3>Plan nutrition and symbiosis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nitrogen fixing bacteria
<ul>
<li>Convert atmospheric bacteria (N2) to ammonia (NH3)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ammonifying Bacteria
<ul>
<li>Decompose organic matter, creating more ammonium</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nitrifying Bacteria
<ul>
<li>Convert ammonium to nitrates, to be absorbed by plant</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Root Nodules &quot;activate&quot; when a plant needs nitrogen. Nitrifying bacteria are stored in the nodules.</p>
<p><em>Mycorrhizae</em> is a type of fungi that coats the roots of a plant. Like an extension of root hair, helps absorb things from the soil. Also releases some antibiotics into the soil. interesting.</p>
<p>Orchids don't require much water - 1 to 2 ice cubes will last a week.</p>
<p>Some plants (Venus fly traps) capture and digest small animals (insects)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notecard</p>
<ul>
<li>True/False</li>
<li>a factor that influences guard cell activity</li>
<li>what causes phloem sap to flow from sugar source to sink?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>Next Chapter!</h2>
<ul>
<li>Plant hormones are found in very small concentrations</li>
<li>There are roughly 5 types of hormones, all deal with promoting/inhibiting growth.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a terrible image but it's word-for-word from the slides</p>

<p>Tropism - a plant growing towards or away from an organism</p>
<ul>
<li>Darwin's Experiment
<ul>
<li>Control plant grew towards light</li>
<li>Plant with tip removed went up</li>
<li>plant with tip covered by cap went up</li>
<li>plant with tip covered by transparent cap grew towards light</li>
<li>plant with base covered by opaque shield grew towards light</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Part II
<ul>
<li>Limiting communication between the tip and stem decreased but did not eliminate growth towards light.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Auxins</p>
<p>released from apical meristem, stimulates elongation of roots and stems. Low amounts stimulate roots, higher amounts inhibit roots and stimulate stems, even higher amounts inhibits both roots and stems.</p>
<p>Cytokinins</p>
<ul>
<li>Delay Aging</li>
<li>produced in roots</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Liquid immortality</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gibberellins</p>
<ul>
<li>causes elongation, &quot;bolting&quot;, going fast</li>
<li>makes grapes less circular and happy, more narrow and dense - they're trying to <em>go</em>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It's like caffeine, but for plants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abscisic acid (aba)</p>
<ul>
<li>wears many hats</li>
<li>Slows growth down</li>
<li>high concentrations promote seed dormancy
<ul>
<li>ABA must be removed/deactivated for germination to happen</li>
<li>ratio of ABA to Gibberellins controls germination</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>conserve energy, survive drought.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It makes the plants feel tired.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ethylene</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaseous by-product of coal combustion</li>
<li>natural occurring plant hormone</li>
<li>found in aging tissues</li>
<li>ripens fruits</li>
<li>programed cell death
<ul>
<li>Leaf senescence (change color)</li>
<li>Leaf abscission (fall off)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>response to stress (shorter days, injury)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Response to Stimuli</h3>
<p>Tropism - directed growth, towards or away a stimuli</p>
<ul>
<li>Gravitropism - it knows which way is down</li>
<li>Thigmotropism - it knows when something touches it</li>
</ul>
<p>Plants have circadian rhythms.</p>
<ul>
<li>influenced by environmental cues, light.</li>
<li>controlled by internal time-keeping</li>
</ul>

<p>The above bean plant wants the sunlight at noon, and is taking a break at midnight.</p>
<p>Short day vs Long day plants.</p>
<p>Some plants will flower only when experiencing shorter periods of UV radiation - shorter daytimes.</p>
<p>Long day plants will flower when the days are long enough.</p>
