<h1>Database JAN18 - Composite Primary Key, Intro to queries</h1>
<p>Text file for today is <a href="../bonus/JAN18-cmds.txt">Here.</a></p>
<p>SQL file for today is <a href="../bonus/JAN18.sql">Here.</a></p>
<p>Getting Started:</p>
<pre><code>mysql -u root -p --verbose
SOURCE C:\path\to\JAN18.sql
TEE C:\path\to\tee\file.txt
</code></pre>
<h3>Database structure and foreign keys</h3>
<p>Databases are made up of <em>tables</em>.</p>
<p>Tables consist of multiple columns, each of which is a <em>field</em>, and has a name.</p>
<p>Each entry in the table can be called a Tuple, Row, Record, they're all the same.</p>
<p>Each table has one column with the primary key attribute - the data in the primary key field
must <em>uniquely</em> identify the record.</p>
<p>A column can have the <em>foreign key</em> attribute, where the data it holds is the
primary key for an entry in another table.</p>
<p>For example, each item in the products table has a supplierID field with the
foreign key attribute. This can be used to look up the supplier of that product in
the suppliers table.</p>
<h3>What's Prof up to?</h3>
<p>I'm using the TV sql file linked above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is basically notes.txt from MyCourses with my own notes on top</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>DESC play</code> - describe the play table. Multiple fields are labeled as <code>PRI</code>, or
primary key - this means the primary key is <em>composite</em>, or made of multiple fields.</p>
<p><code>DESC tvstation</code> - Channel is the primary key - each station uses a unique channel. The multiple
NULL fields allow the information to be missing.</p>
<p><code>SELECT * FROM tvstation</code> - get everything out of this table. See it all.</p>
<p><code>SELECT * FROM tvstation WHERE city = &quot;Rochester&quot;;</code> - Get all the records in which the
city field is set to &quot;Rochester&quot;.</p>
<p><code>SELECT * FROM tvstation WHERE city IS NULL;</code> - this should be obvious</p>
<p><code>SELECT channel, callLetters, phone FROM tvstation;</code> - Get only some specific columns.</p>
<p><code>SHOW CREATE TABLE play;</code> - Displays how the table was created. This helps us see
what constraints are set, such as foreign keys.</p>
<p>In the play table, the channel column is a foreign key that references the channel column in the tvstation table.</p>
<p><code>SELECT name,playDate, playTime, channel FROM play order by name;</code> -
Selected data is now in order, alphabetically by name. Add <code>DESC</code> to the end to
reverse the order.</p>
<p><code>SELECT * FROM play WHERE channel IN (8, 13, 31);</code> - IN compares the value to all items
of a set. The set is denoted by <code>(8, 13, 31)</code>.</p>
<h1>END</h1>
<p>This got real interesting real fast. Let's go.</p>
