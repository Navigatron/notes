<h1>Mon Mar 01 2021 19:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time):</h1>
<h2>Administrative</h2>
<ul>
<li>Assignment 2 is coming up - the 4th?
<ul>
<li>The rest of it got delayed, it might be delayed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assignment 3 is released</li>
<li>There is a take home test coming up
<ul>
<li>4 hour time limit</li>
<li>it should take 1 hour</li>
<li>it might take 2 hours</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chapter 6 Discussion</h2>
<p>Heuristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>availability: prob of occurrence of event
<ul>
<li>prob(running into a cop on the drive to work)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>representativeness</li>
</ul>
<p>How to account for subjective probability?</p>
<p>Non-experts show overconfidence. Calibration attempts to account for this.</p>
<h2>Chapter 7 discussion</h2>
<p>How to perform a probability assessment</p>
<ul>
<li>stanford assessment</li>
<li>&quot;epi&quot; protocol?</li>
</ul>
<p>How to get reliable, consistent, accurate data from experts?</p>
<p>The Delphi Method:</p>
<ul>
<li>ask everybody the question</li>
<li>compile a report and send it to everybody</li>
<li>Ask the question again, letting people change their answers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Availability bias: we only really consider things that we know about.</p>
<p>Anchor and adjust bias: we know this number, and adjust to account for problems that we know about.</p>
<h2>PDFs and CDFs</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Am I gonna have to turn on mathjax lol</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probability Density function: What is the probability of X happening, given parameter Y? This is the classic bell curve.</p>
<p>Cumulative Density Function: The probability of X happening, given that parameter Y is at <em>or less than</em> some value. It's the integral of the PDF.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is going to take tikz in the pdfs. I barely know tikz.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Expert Elicitation</h1>
<p><em>When google fails.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We have a question</li>
<li>It's very hard to measure</li>
<li>It's very hard to estimate</li>
</ul>
<p>It's time to find an adult who knows what they're doing. Or lots of them. But we can't just ask them what they think:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bias!
<ul>
<li>The weatherman says it's going to snow <em>A LOT</em>.</li>
<li>(It turns out they get the percentages roughly right, but I'm still convinced they overestimate amounts.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The person we're asking might not be good at statistics
<ul>
<li>The 70th percentile of grilled-cheese doneness is sunflower golden.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Estimation Exercise</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A series of questions with numerical answers. No looking things up. Provide your best guess and your 90% confidence interval.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Example: How many ice cream shops are in the city of Rochester?
<ul>
<li>Probably 40?</li>
<li>Almost certainly between 5 and 300</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How long is the Erie canal, in miles?
<ul>
<li>Like, 100 miles?</li>
<li>Almost certainly between 5 and 200</li>
<li>Answer: 363 miles. (3 students got it)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How long is the suez canal? (I've never heard of this canal)
<ul>
<li>Could be 40 miles</li>
<li>Probably between 2 and 100</li>
<li>Answer: 120 miles. (6 students got it)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Area, in square miles, of the city of Rochester
<ul>
<li>I'm guessing a square, 10 miles to a side, so 100 sq miles</li>
<li>Probably more than 9sqm, less than 400</li>
<li>Answer: 37.1 (4 correct)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Area, in square miles, of the city of Los Angeles?
<ul>
<li>A square, 50 miles to a side, 2500 sqm</li>
<li>More than 100, less than 10,000</li>
<li>Answer: 502 sq miles (5)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the population of New York State?
<ul>
<li>50 million</li>
<li>Between 10 mil and 200 mil</li>
<li>Answer: 19.5 million (2)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the population of Australia?
<ul>
<li>10 million</li>
<li>1 mil to 80 mil</li>
<li>Answer: 25.3 mil (5)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If we were good at making confidence intervals, we should capture the correct value 90% of the time. But at best, we saw 60%. Our ranges were too small, we were too confident in our answers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I captured the right answer in 4 of 6 questions, or 66% of the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We were overconfident in the familiar questions, and <em>still</em> overconfident with unfamiliar questions.</p>
<h3>This is graphable</h3>
<p>We say that infrequent things, never happen. And common things, always happen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Everyone is overconfident; in Everything; All the time.&quot; - Prof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except weather forecasters, apparently. They predict things, with percentages, every day. And they get quick feedback.</p>
<p>Good job, weatherman.</p>
