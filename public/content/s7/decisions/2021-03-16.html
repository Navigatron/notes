<h1>Mon Mar 15 2021 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time):</h1>
<p>The test is taking the place of next class. It's available from 10AM to 2PM, and should take about an hour.</p>
<p>Buy the textbook! Signal and the Noise.</p>
<p>Regression is coming in soon. You need software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stata</li>
<li>Excel (though not recommended)</li>
<li>R</li>
<li>Matlab</li>
<li>minitab</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel like I'm gonna need mathjax for today. My mathjax is rusty but we'll get through it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Probability Question Example</h2>
<p>In the next 10 minutes, 30 busses will arrive at the bus station. One of them will be the RIT bus.</p>
<p>50% of RIT people wear RIT gear/swag, while the background rate is 2%.</p>
<p>A bus arrives. The first person off is wearing an RIT hat. Is this the RIT bus?</p>
<p>The second person off the bus is <em>not</em> wearing RIT swag. Is this the RIT bus?</p>
<p>The third person is wearing an RIT shirt. Is this the RIT bus?</p>
<h2>Approaches</h2>
<h3>Bayesian</h3>
<p>A Bayesian starts with a &quot;prior probability&quot;, and then uses each new piece of data to adjust their expected probability that something is true.</p>
<p>The probability of A given B is A intersection B over B</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MATHJAX ENGAGED!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$</p>
<p>Let's define some sets:</p>
<p>$$
A = {\text{RIT Bus}, \text{Regular Bus}} \
B = {\text{RIT Swagged}, \text{Regular swag}}
$$</p>
<p>Remember that $P(A=\text{Swagged})$ is the probability of set $A$ evaluating to Swagged.</p>
<p>$$
P(A = \text{RIT Bus} | B = \text{RIT Swagged}) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A = \text{RIT Bus})}{P(B=\text{RIT Swagged})} = \frac{0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{30}}{P(B=\text{RIT Swagged})}
$$</p>
<p>But, how often do we expect to see someone in RIT gear, from any bus?</p>
<p>$$
P(B) = P(A = \text{RIT Bus}) \cdot P(B = \text{RIT Swagged} | A = \text{RIT Bus}) + P(A = \text{Regular Bus}) \cdot P(B = \text{Regular swag} | A = \text{Regular Bus}) = \frac{1}{30} \cdot 0.5 + \frac{29}{30} \cdot 0.02 = 0.036
$$</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<p>$$
P(A = \text{RIT Bus} | B = \text{RIT Swagged}) = \frac{0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{30}}{0.036} = 0.4630
$$</p>
<p>After seing the <em>first</em> person, there is a 46% chance that this is the RIT bus.</p>
<p>To calculate the second person, we now have to use 46% as our prior probability ($P(A=\text{RIT Bus})$).</p>
<h3>Frequentist</h3>
<p>A frequentist looks at the data, and finds the probability of this outcome from a random sample under a &quot;null hypothesis&quot;.</p>
<p>Null Hypothesis: This is a regular bus. The probability of the first person off having RIT gear is 2%. &quot;You are 98% confident that this is not a normal bus&quot; (that's technically incorrect). If you use a threshold of 95%, then we can safely reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>The second person is not wearing gear: $P=(0.2)<em>(0.98)</em>(2)=0.392$</p>
<h2>Three Card Monte problem</h2>
<p>The game: There are 2 black cards and 1 red card. They are shuffled, and if you pick the red one, then you win.</p>
<p>We're a frequentist, and we suspect that the game is rigged.</p>
<p>Null Hypothesis: Everything is fine.</p>
<p>The first loss: This is expected. We would see this 66% of the time. Cool.</p>
<p>The second loss: $(2/3)^2 = 0.444$ , not unheard of</p>
<p>We would see 7 losses 5.9% of the time. We would see 8 losses 3.9% of the time.</p>
<p>The probability of this outcome (8 losses, 0 wins), given our null hypothesis, is exceedingly rare (3.9%). Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis. The game is rigged!</p>
<h3>Bayesian</h3>
<p>we'll enter with 40% confidence that the game is rigged.</p>
<p>$$
A = {\text{Rigged}, \text{Chill}} \
B = {\text{Loss}, \text{Win}} \
P(A=\text{Rigged}|B=\text{Loss}) = \frac{P(B=\text{Loss}|A=\text{Rigged})\cdot P(A=\text{Rigged})}{P(B=\text{Loss})}
$$</p>
<p>But what is the probability that we lose?</p>
<p>$$
P(B=\text{Loss}) = P(B=\text{Loss}|A=\text{Rigged})\cdot P(A=\text{Rigged}) + P(B=\text{Loss}|A=\text{Chill})\cdot P(A=\text{Chill}) = 1 * 0.4 + 0.33 * 0.6 = 0.598
$$</p>
<p>If $P(A=\text{Rigged})=0.4$, then $P(B=\text{Loss})=0.598$ for the first iteration.</p>
<p>$$
P(A=\text{Rigged}|B=\text{Loss}) = (1*0.4)/0.598 = 0.6689
$$</p>
<p>Recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>We assumed there was a 40% chance the game was rigged</li>
<li>We played the game, and lost</li>
<li>We think there's a 67% chance the game is rigged</li>
</ul>
<p>We now need to repeat to get an answer.</p>

<p>I want to write a program for this. I should also learn R, huh?</p>

<p>Time to try uploading to github and debugging my mathjax lmao</p>
