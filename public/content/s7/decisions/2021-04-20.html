<p>Decision Trees! Not on assignment 6. (Assignment 6, by the way, is a big one. Start soon!) Meanwhile, decisions trees will definitely be on the test.</p>
<h2>The snowstorm example</h2>
<p>You're traveling home for winter break, and have three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Train, which takes 8 hours</li>
<li>Car, which could take 5, 7, or 9 hours depending on how it goes</li>
<li>Airplane, which takes 2 hours, unless the flights are grounded due to snow
<ul>
<li>If the flights are grounded, you have to pick another option.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The car has a 25% chance of going smoothly, and a 40% chance of going okay. The flights have a 60% chance of being grounded.</p>
<p><img src="./images/2021-04-20.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We see that the best <strong>Strategy</strong> is to head to the airport. If the flights are grounded, the car is the backup.</p>
<h2>Risk Profiles</h2>
<p>A <strong>Strategy</strong> is your plan at the start of a decision tree - it's a roadmap from the start to the end. In the snowstorm example, our strategy is to head to the airport, and if the flights are grounded, take a car.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strategy: <em>&quot;Choose X, and then if Y happens, choose Z.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For each strategy, you can find the probability of each possible outcome. This graph, of outcomes on the X axis and probability on the Y, is a <em>risk profile</em>.</p>
<h2>Value of Information</h2>
<p>Our decision trees are based on our best guesses of the probabilities. We can find out how much information is worth to us by looking at the decision trees.</p>
<p>Normally, we decide which path to take, and then chance nodes resolve. To find the <strong>Expected Value of Perfect Information</strong>, put your chance node first - then make your decisions knowing the output. If this model gives you a higher expected value, then the information is valuable - and you know exactly how valuable.</p>
<p>TODO - add some example diagrams here.</p>
