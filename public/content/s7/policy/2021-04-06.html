<h1>Mon Apr 05 2021 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time):</h1>
<p>The take home exam is open-book and open-note. With these resources, you must work on the exam alone.</p>
<p>The exam will be open for 48 hours, starting this Thursday morning at 8am, and closing at 8am on Saturday.</p>
<p>Questions with a star (*) have more than one correct answer. If there is no star, then there is only one correct answer.</p>
<p>The open ended questions are not short essay questions, but responses should still be thorough.</p>
<p>The exam will be emailed out as a microsoft word document. It should be submitted as a word doc or pdf to the MyCourses dropbox.</p>
<h2>Porter Hypothesis</h2>
<p>Environmental regulations can induce innovation.</p>
<p>The Porter Hypothesis says that it also increases the competitiveness of firms by increasing the &quot;resource efficiency&quot; of production.</p>
<h2>Diffusion</h2>
<p>Diffusion is the spread of new technology throughout society. This happens through <em>communication</em>.</p>
<p>There are a few definitions of diffusion - it could also be <em>adoption</em>.</p>
<p>Innovations do not sell themselves - there are barriers to diffusion. The inherent value of an innovation is not always readily apparent to investors.</p>
<h2>What affects diffusion?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Relative Advantage
<ul>
<li>Things that are better give higher incentive to use</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compatibility
<ul>
<li>Things that are compatible with existing systems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Complexity
<ul>
<li>simpler things are easier to get going</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trial-ability
<ul>
<li>Things you can test first are easier to get going</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Observability
<ul>
<li>Things you can see are easier to get going</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An alternative model: Diffusion is the result of individual decision making, weighing the benefits of the new technology against the costs of change.</p>
<h2>The S-shaped diffusion curve</h2>
<p>At the start, very few people adopt the technology. Over time, adoption accelerates, before slowly reaching 100% with the hold-outs.</p>
