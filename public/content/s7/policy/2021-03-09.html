<h1>Mon Feb 08 2021 19:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time):</h1>
<p>The Topic Proposal is due by the end of the week.</p>
<p>The first paper, the policy background, will be due the end of next week.</p>
<h2>Patents vs Trade Secrets</h2>
<p>While patenting provides a temporary monopoly, it does require disclosing the invention. This could bring licensing royalties.</p>
<p>A trade secret has its pros and cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>No requirement to disclose</li>
<li>No possibility for royalties</li>
<li>Harder to defend</li>
<li>Less innovation</li>
</ul>
<h3>BioTech</h3>
<p>BioTech typically uses patents, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple: The patent is the product
<ul>
<li>easy to prove uniqueness</li>
<li>easy to enforce infringements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strong motivations for protection:
<ul>
<li>Extremely high R&amp;D costs</li>
<li>Very low reproduction/replication cost</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Computer Software</h3>
<p>It wasn't until the 1980s that programs had serious patent protection. The key distinction is between mathematics, and the specific <em>implementation</em> of the algorithm.</p>
<p>Reminder of patent requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Novel</li>
<li>Useful</li>
<li>non-obvious</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon's 1-click ordering was patented in 1999, but has been critiqued as very obvious.</p>
<p>Apple's siri patent took 8 years to get approval, since it wasn't very specific - it described abstractly how the software might function.</p>
<h2>Patent Problems</h2>
<p>Software patenting doesn't really encourage innovation. It's most often used strategically.</p>
<p>Companies say that lead time / first-mover advantage is more important to spurring innovation. Even with no patent protection, being the first in the market grants a temporary monopoly.</p>
<p>The iPhone's first competitor came out 18 months after launch - but at that point, the iPhone had sold 5 million units and had established brand loyalty.</p>
