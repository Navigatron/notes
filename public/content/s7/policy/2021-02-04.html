<h1>What is Technology?</h1>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Today is a Thursday - Tuesday's class was moved to today due to Prof traveling. Next class will be in-person during the normal time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Discussion Posts</strong> - there is no word count, but Prof. does check to make sure all the questions are at least addressed. Discussion posts are worth 2 points each, and are not book questions - they are very open ended, there are no wrong answers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since this week was shuffled a little bit, there is no discussion post. However, not everyone has answered last week's discussion; Prof. will leave it open for this week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prof.'s office hours are Wednesday mornings; Prof. is open to any questions.</p>
<p>There is a reading that should be completed by next Tuesday's class.</p>
<h2>What is Technology?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Artifacts and Tools</li>
<li>Techniques or Ways</li>
<li>Social... things?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This mirrors the business acronym &quot;PPT&quot; - People, Processes, and Technology (aka social, techniques, and tools)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We use technology to address needs and solve problems. Some technologies create their own need. They can be created in the face of a problem, or completely accidentally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.&quot; - Henry Ford</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technology increases productivity, and therefore creates more wealth. A carpenter with a nail gun can build more houses than one with just a hammer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the productivity gain from the nail gun is worth more than the interest cost of a loan, then it is worth it for the carpenter to take out a loan to buy the nail gun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>$$
\delta \text{Productivity}=\delta \text{Capital} + \delta \text{Labor} + \delta \text{Tech}
$$</p>
<p>Countries with more earthquake-proof building innovation have less earthquake deaths.</p>
<p>New technologies can also introduce new risks. Nuclear power generates nuclear waste, and refrigerators can leak coolant into the atmosphere.</p>
<h2>What is technological change and innovation?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Invention
<ul>
<li>Creating something new!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Innovation
<ul>
<li>Developing an invention for commercial use</li>
<li>Implementing the invention for the real world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Diffusion
<ul>
<li>The spread of technology throughout society</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>After-class: video on disruptive innovation is on MyCourses</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What is public policy?</h2>
<p>Technology and Policy both try to solve problems, and have impacts on each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Class next week is in person!</p>
</blockquote>
