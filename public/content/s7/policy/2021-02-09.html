<h1>Mon Feb 08 2021 19:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time):</h1>
<p>Invention creates a brand-new technology.</p>
<p>Innovation adopts the new technology for commercial use, resulting in new or improved products or processes.</p>
<p>Innovation also includes using old technologies in new ways.</p>
<h2>What pushes innovation?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Technology Push</li>
<li>Demand Pull</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology Push</h3>
<p>The supply of new ideas and the accumulation of basic knowledge increases technological opportunity.</p>
<p>Basic science and technology creates foundational building blocks.</p>
<h3>Demand Pull</h3>
<p>This is focused on the benefits that will come from a new innovation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Induced Innovation Hypothesis: The price of &quot;Factors&quot; influence the desirability of innovation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If labor prices rise, the demand for labor-saving innovations rises.</p>
<p>Earthquakes and Floods increase the demand for earthquake and flood-proof technologies.</p>
<p>As energy prices rise, innovation in energy-efficient vehicles is accelerated.</p>
<h2>Government Innovation</h2>
<p>Public policy can influence innovation through both tech-push and demand-pull. But first: <em>Why should the gov. influence innovation?</em> Why not leave it to the market?</p>
<h3>What is Public policy?</h3>
<p>Policy is what a gov. intends to do about a problem. It is not the <em>goal</em>, but the <em>strategy</em>.</p>
<p>Policies are most often justified by <em>Market Failures</em>, where the market fails to allocate resources in the &quot;best&quot; way.</p>
<h3>Public Goods</h3>
<p>These are goods that everyone can benefit from, and nobody can be excluded.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Rival</strong> - one person using the good does not exclude another. If I eat some cheese, you cannot have the same cheese. If I listen to the radio, you can still listen to the radio.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Excludable</strong> - people cannot be prevented from using the good.</p>
<p><em>Knowledge</em> is a public good - it can be spread freely without using it up, and it cannot be contained (once released).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think there are strategies to exclude people from just about anything. Are radio waves still public goods if radio components are free?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since public goods are difficult to profit off of, they are <em>underprovided</em> by the free market. This isn't to say they aren't provided - but there should be more.</p>
<h3>Knowledge Spillover</h3>
<p>This is when invention or innovation in one sector leads to new inventions/innovations/knowledge in other sectors. For example, technologies from NASA's moon missions now pervade everyday life. (Memory foam, fireproof materials, integrated circuits)</p>
<p>Knowledge Spillover happens through channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publication
<ul>
<li>Researchers publish their work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Humans
<ul>
<li>Workers who change jobs bring knowledge with them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reverse Engineering
<ul>
<li>Decomposing a product to duplicate or enhance it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of R&amp;D</h3>
<table>

<td>Pasteur: User-inspired research</td>

<ul>
<li>Edison</li>

<li>Industrial Chemistry</li>
</ul>

<li>Rickover</li>
<li>Bohr
<ul>
<li>National Laboratories</li>
<li>Makes things like Submarines</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The science axis could be called &quot;Quest for Fundamental Understanding&quot;.
The gov/market axis could be called &quot;Consideration of Use&quot;, where market is applied and gov is &quot;curiosity&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do the Rickover and Bohr quadrants improve our lives? Then isn't there a free-market incentive to perform them?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Innovation System</h3>
<p>There are a lot of agents involved, that all must interact.</p>
<p>If the components do not interact efficiently, then technological innovation could be slowed. This is a systemic failure, rather than an issue with any individual component.</p>
<h3>Justifications for Gov. Intervention</h3>
<ul>
<li>Market Failures
<ul>
<li>There may not be <em>enough</em> incentive in the market to pursue an innovation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Knowledge Spillovers
<ul>
<li>New knowledge in one sector can have upside in other fields</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Basic Science
<ul>
<li>The market tends to invest less in basic science</li>
<li>Basic science forms building blocks for more applied developments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Systemic Failure
<ul>
<li>Tech. innovation slows down if different agents interact poorly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Group Discussion Project</h1>
<p>There is a group discussion project this week. Prof. will assign groups via MyCourses, and will send an email with more details.</p>
