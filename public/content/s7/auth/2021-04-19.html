<p>Complexity theory: P does not equal NP. I have no idea what this means.</p>
<p>NP-complete and NP-hard mean a problem is hard. Apparently they are so hard that quantum computers might not make them easy.</p>
<h2>Lattice-Based Crypto</h2>
<p>A lattice is an infinite grid. From here, prof went on about &quot;dimensionality&quot;, and never talked about how it works.</p>
<h2>Ring Learning With Errors key Exchange</h2>
<p>?</p>
<h2>Multivariate Cryptography</h2>
<p>Something something multivariate polynomials.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It has a short signature, which is useful&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above block quote is meaningless without further explanation. Thanks prof.</p>
<p>We can hide quadratic equations in oil and vinegar, but the oil and vinegar have to be unbalanced.</p>
<h2>Hash-based cryptography</h2>
<p>Merkle trees are cool - it's a hash of hashes. So far, this is the only part of today's lecture that makes sense.</p>
<h2>McEliece Cryptosystem</h2>
<p>Uses large matrices as keys, uses randomization, faster than RSA, never saw wide adoption.</p>
