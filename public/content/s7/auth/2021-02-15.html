<h1>Sun Feb 14 2021 19:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time):</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a number of things due this week. There are a number of things due next week. Prof. will not tell you exactly what, or when, or where exactly to check. Good luck!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data owners have discretion to assign/allow/restrict access to data.</p>
<p>MULTICS = Multiplexed Information and Computing Service. The access control system of MULTICS inspired modern access control schemes, and pioneered the idea of rings. RuBAC = Rules based access control.</p>
<p>Subjects request action on an object:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read</li>
<li>Write</li>
<li>Open a socket</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>The owner of the file may set the access control matrix: Lookup(Subject, Object), returns the allowed actions.</p>
<h2>ACLs vs Capability lists</h2>
<p>An ACL is just a list. If every object needs an ACL, and every ACL is a list, well that's pretty heavy.</p>
<p>An ACL is defined on the file - who has what access level.</p>
<p>A Capability List is defined on the subject - what things do they have access to.</p>
<h2>Confused Deputy</h2>
<h2>Windows Access Control</h2>
<p>Access Tokens: contain information about the user</p>
<p>Sceurity Descriptors: list of who can do what with the thing, how to audit attempts w/ the object. Applied to securable objects.</p>
<p>A successful logon creates a new access token, which is copied into every process started by that user. On the NTFS filesystem, files have a security header where the security descriptor lives.</p>
<p>If the Discretionary Access Control list (DACL) isn't specified, then it fails open - everyone can access.</p>
<p>There are three types of access control entries (ACEs):</p>
<ul>
<li>Access Allowed</li>
<li>Access Denied</li>
<li>System Audit
<ul>
<li>What does this do?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An explicit deny ACE overrides an explicit allow ACE. Ace's contain a few things, including the SID it applies to. SIDs are made of a few fields.</p>
