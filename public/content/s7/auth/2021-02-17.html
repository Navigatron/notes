<h2>Administrative</h2>
<p>TA recommends doing lab2 on a local machine. It relies on <code>responder</code>, which causes network noise - doing the lab on RLES results in cross-team communication.</p>
<p>Prof. &quot;beat us up&quot; on the first source summary grade, to give lots of feedback. SS1 accounts for ~0.5% of the final grade, so those of us with poor grades should not stress.</p>
<p>Prof. wants edit rights on the google sheet to make grading easier. All PDF links should point into a shared folder.</p>
<p>For submissions, PDF only the current week's rows.</p>
<p>Future source summaries will receive less feedback in the future, but will be more pass/fail in grading. &quot;Just do it.&quot;</p>
<p>The final paper methods section should include journals and search terms used to locate source summaries.</p>
<p>Prof. recommends using existing literature reviews as early source summaries, as they will show us what &quot;good&quot; looks like.</p>
<p>&quot;Target Population for the Study&quot; - This is not the target audience, but what the study was on.</p>
<p>Research Hypothesis is the core question. Research design is how they're designing the research in such a way to answer the question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Groups split into breakout rooms to discuss Lab2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For source summary set 3 (sss3), we will be doing peer-reviews of earlier source summary sets.</p>
