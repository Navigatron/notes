<h1>Sat Sep 04 2021 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time):</h1>
<p>We live in an imperfect world, with plenty of problems. Some of these problems are more impactful than others.</p>
<p>Public policy is made in response to a problem. It's oriented to some goal.</p>
<p>We often find disagreement in exactly what problem may be, its causes, or how to <em>best</em> fix it.</p>
<p>Birkland argues that there are four fundamental goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equity</li>
<li>Efficiency</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Liberty</li>
</ul>
<p>A policy is not guaranteed to be <em>effective</em> at working towards its goal.</p>
<p>Policies often have broad scopes - they're said to be &quot;in the public's interest&quot;.</p>
<p>Policy is made by governments, and enforced by governments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Policy is what the government chooses to do or not to do.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
