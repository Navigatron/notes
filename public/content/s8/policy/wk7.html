<h1>Sat Oct 09 2021 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time):</h1>
<p>The policy making process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue Emergence</li>
<li>Agenda Setting</li>
<li>Alternative Selection</li>
<li>Enactment</li>
<li>Implmenetation</li>
<li>Evaluation</li>
<li>Repeat!</li>
</ul>
<p>Agenda setting is the act of prioritizing problems.</p>
<p>An agenda is a collection of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems</li>
<li>Understandings of causes</li>
<li>potential solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Policy actors compete to get their problems higher on the agenda, or push other problems off the agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;The Agenda&quot; has many levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>The agenda universe
<ul>
<li>All ideas are here, though not all are publicly talked about</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Systemic Agenda
<ul>
<li>Ideas inside the overton window</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Institutional Agenda
<ul>
<li>Things policy makers might consider</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decision Agenda
<ul>
<li>Things policy makers are acting or will act on</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Indicators are often statistical measurements that can point to a problem.</p>
<p>A focusing event is a sudden event that can pull public focus to the problem.</p>
<p>&lt;!--
Discussion Post:</p>
<p>Focus on a social problem and try to use indicators or focusing events to describe its severity. For indicators, please keep in mind that you do not want to manipulate the measurement or presentation of the data but rather use the most appropriate, valid data collected by government agencies to illustrate the problem. I encourage you to include figures or charts to present your indicators and also include relevant references or sources of information.</p>
<p>For focusing events,  please describe and explain how the event(s) helped generate attention to your selected problem as well as the policy actors and groups involved in this event or those that helped advance the event(s) on the agenda. Please note that the focusing events do not have to lead to policy changes. Please do not use the same examples in the lecture slides.</p>
<p>Your response to this prompt and comment to one of your peers should be posted by Sunday at midnight to receive full credit.</p>
