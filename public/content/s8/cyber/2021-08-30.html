<h1>Sun Aug 29 2021 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time):</h1>
<h2>Cybersecurity Hurdles</h2>
<p><strong>Organizational Silos</strong> - they don't often talk to each other, outside of incidents. There is a push for a &quot;Chief Risk Officer&quot; - who's job is to break the boundaries between these silos.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient Business Involvement</strong> - csec isn't a technological problem, it's a business problem.</p>
<p><strong>Over-reliance on training and communications</strong> - If you have the training, cyber insurance will cover you; but you can't rely on just that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Cyber resilient organizations can contain attacks without relying solely on people as the way to mitigate risk.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Talent Shortfalls</strong> - we just don't have enough people.</p>
<h2>The state of Cybersecurity</h2>
<p>What's out there?</p>
<p><strong>Nation State Threats</strong> - These boys are big, and to assume they only attack govs is a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Organized Crime and hackers</strong> - The black market provides tools and even customer support.</p>
<p><strong>Hacktivists</strong> - hacking for political or social causes. No matter what you're doing, someone out there doesn't like it.</p>
<p><strong>Insider Threat</strong> - Employees, Vendors, Contractors; often approached by black market actors offering funds for info.</p>
<p><strong>Substandard Products and Services</strong> - Not everything you interact with is as good as you are.</p>
<h2>Frameworks</h2>
<p>A framework is a checklist to make your auditors happy.</p>
<h3>NIPP 2013</h3>
<p>This started with critical infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chemical</li>
<li>Commercial favilities</li>
<li>Communications</li>
<li>Critical manuafacturing</li>
<li>Dams defense industrial base</li>
<li>Emergency services</li>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Financial services</li>
<li>Food and Agriculture</li>
<li>Gov. Facilities</li>
<li>Healthcare / public health</li>
<li>Information Technology</li>
<li>Nuclear reactors, materials, waste</li>
<li>Transportation systems</li>
<li>Water systems</li>
<li>Wastewater systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Evolving Threats to Critical Infrastructure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pandemics</li>
<li>Extreme Weather</li>
<li>Accidents or Technical Failures
<ul>
<li>Solar flare?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cyber Threats</li>
<li>Acts of Terrorism</li>
</ul>
<h3>ISO 27001</h3>
<p>International Standards Organization publishes high-level &quot;best practices&quot;. It looks at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical and environmental security
<ul>
<li>&quot;Gates, Guards, and Guns&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Access control and access management
<ul>
<li>card swipes lmao</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IT security Practices</li>
<li>Cryptography
<ul>
<li>Keep them credit cards on lock</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Communication Security
<ul>
<li>HTTPS</li>
<li>Shredders</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Incident Management and Compliance
<ul>
<li>PICERL</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This framework suggests <em>hundreds</em> of potential controls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you know your blinky lights are working? Evaluation is important.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>COBIT-5</h3>
<p>By the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA).</p>
<p>Another thick one. It's expensive too.</p>
<h3>PCI DSS</h3>
<p>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.</p>
<p>If you want to interact with payment card gateways, you have to be in compliance with this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This is a smaller framework&quot; - Prof. If this is small, I can't imagine what the big ones are.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>CIS Critical Security Controls</h3>
<p>A set of recommended controls. A large group of volunteers maintains this set.</p>
<h3>FISMA</h3>
<p>Federal information Security Modernization Act.</p>
<h3>NIST CSF</h3>
<p>National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework.</p>
<p>The latest framework. Very popular. It's made by NIST, free for everyone.</p>
<p>This is the one we'll be focusing on for the rest of the course.</p>
<p>The 5 core areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify</li>
<li>Protect</li>
<li>Detect</li>
<li>Respond</li>
<li>Recover</li>
</ul>
<p>NIST CSF comes with mappings, to connect it to a ton of other frameworks.</p>
<p>Who uses the CSF?</p>
<ul>
<li>Senior Executives
<ul>
<li>How do we protect the company?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implementations / Operations
<ul>
<li>They do the technicals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Specialists in Other Fields</li>
</ul>
<p>A nist CSF Profile - what is this? It's a profile of where an organization stands by the CSF's standards. How does the org measure up?</p>
<p>The 7 step process</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritize and Scope
<ul>
<li>What are our organizational goals?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Orient
<ul>
<li>What are our assets?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a Current Profile
<ul>
<li>Where am I?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conduct a Risk Assessment
<ul>
<li>Where should I go?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a Target Profile
<ul>
<li>Where exactly do I want to go</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Determine, Analyze, Prioritize Gaps
<ul>
<li>What is the difference between here and there?</li>
<li>Which gap is the most important?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implementation Action Plan
<ul>
<li>LESSGOOOO</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Homework</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1 of The basics of Information Security</li>
<li>Chapter 1 of Cybersecurity for Executives</li>
<li>Other articles in MyCourses</li>
<li>Homework Document
<ul>
<li>Will be posted soon</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some information will be coming out over slack in the next few days.</p>
