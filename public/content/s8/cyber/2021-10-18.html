<h1>Sun Oct 17 2021 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time):</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>We missed the 4th because prof canceled
We missed the 11th for RIT fall break</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sprint 1 due next class<br>
Sprint 2 has been released - due in two weeks
There was no midterm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are transitioning to &quot;Phase 2&quot; of the class - resilience and recovery.</p>
<p>We're going to talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governance</li>
<li>Change management</li>
<li>personell management</li>
</ul>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p>This is how the company operates. It's the guard rails, the strategies, the written and unwritten ways of doing things.</p>
<p>Risk management strategies fall in here.</p>
<p>Governance is the collective set of principles, while management is the implementation of these principles. Feedback from management is critical, because it refines the strategy and governance.</p>
<p><em>Strategy</em> is there to implement Vision and Mission. While these may stay the same, the strategy to achieve them may change.</p>
<p>How do we evaluate strategies? Are they working? We gotta test them.</p>
<p>Building strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are we, what do we have to work with?</li>
<li>Where do we want to go?</li>
<li>How do we get there?</li>
</ul>
<p>The three S's: Strategy Steering and Standards.</p>
<p>The four C's support the three S's:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competencies</li>
<li>Conditions</li>
<li>Conduct</li>
<li>Capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>The organization's board determines the strategy and accepts the risk. The board ensures value creation and protects the business. Executives take the board strategy and implement it - <em>Operations</em>.</p>
<p>To know where we are, and if it's different from where we were, we need to take <em>measurements</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's Metrics time!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually dumb acronym time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key Goal Indicators
<ul>
<li>Goals are specific, measurable, and time-relevant</li>
<li>&quot;Serve tacos within 30 seconds of ordering&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Onboard one client per month&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Critical Success Factors
<ul>
<li>Things that are... critical for... success?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Key Performance Indicators
<ul>
<li>What are we measuring? To decide what percentage of the goal we're at?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SMART goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific</li>
<li>Measurable</li>
<li>Achievable</li>
<li>Realistic</li>
<li>Timely</li>
</ul>
<p>CMMI - Capability maturity Model Integration. 5 levels:</p>
<ol>
<li>Processes are ad-hoc</li>
<li>Processes are repeatable</li>
<li>Defined, documented, subject to review and improvement</li>
<li>Processes are managed via a variety of reliable metrics</li>
<li>Processes are optimized with a focus on continual improvement</li>
</ol>
<p>IT and CSEC are parallel but different paths.</p>
<p>IT creates value. It enables, expedites, optimizes, faster, cheaper, easier.</p>
<p>CSEC protects value (risk management). It evaluates, double-checks, restricts, and monitors.</p>
<h2>Change Control</h2>
<p>Things change all the time, we just need to plan for things. If we don't plan, we can react.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the motivation to change</li>
<li>Develop a course of action, or many</li>
<li>Select a course of action</li>
<li>Get approval</li>
<li>Implement the change</li>
<li>Monitor and Evaluate</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sempre Gumby: Always Flexible&quot; - Prof</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>People are the greatest threat.</p>
<p>For optimal performance, you need the right people on the right tasks at the right time.</p>
