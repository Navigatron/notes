<h1>Wed Oct 20 2021 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time):</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The next two sessions are sprint demos</p>
<p>Teams 1 through 4 will demo on Tuesday (5-8 need not attend)</p>
<p>Teams 5 through 8 will demo on Thursday (1-4 need not attend)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today will be a short lecture, followed by an activity.</p>
<p>Code review is a way of putting your code out there and explicitly requesting that others look at it.</p>
<p>Code review is a great way for newer team members to get feedback. For spikes, code review spreads the info throughout the team. There are a few types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual
<ul>
<li>1-on-1 review</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Synchronous
<ul>
<li>Throw it up on a projector, everyone debates</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Async
<ul>
<li>Github comments style</li>
<li>I really like this method, since you can split into multiple conversations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Things to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code practices
<ul>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Defensive techniques</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design practices
<ul>
<li>Adherence to tiers</li>
<li>Adherence to OO principles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Testing practices
<ul>
<li>Are the tests comprehensive?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Documentation
<ul>
<li>Are the docs up to date?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pull request and Code review are now parts of the definition of done in trello.</p>
<p>Remember that code reviews are biased towards pointing out changes - it can be frustrating. It's important to remember that this is growth, and comments shouldn't be taken personally.</p>
<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>Create a pull request, adding everyone on the team and the instructor as reviewers. There is a docx to fill out, available on the class website.</p>
