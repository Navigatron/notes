<h1>Mon Sep 20 2021 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time):</h1>
<p>Administrative stuff:</p>
<p>There is an exam next Tuesday. Has some definitions.
2-sided, hand-written crib sheet is permitted.
Must be handed in after the exam.</p>
<p>There's a review session at some point, expect an email.</p>
<h2>Acceptance Testing</h2>
<p>A user story is a project requirement. The product owner may be involved in writing these.</p>
<p>A user story must pass acceptance tests to be called done. One story will have many tests.</p>
<p><em>Backlog Refinement</em> - when moving a story from the product to sprint backlog, its acceptance criteria must be defined.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria are formatted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Given</strong> criteria, <strong>When</strong> event, <strong>Then</strong> other event.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Acceptance Test Plan</em> is the set of all these tests for a story.</p>
<p>For sprints 1 through 3, we will need to create acceptance test plans.</p>
<h2>Version Control</h2>
<p>A &quot;software release&quot; is a snapshot of code at a certain time. The snapshot captures some set of user stories, and you may need to make multiple snapshots as the code evolves.</p>
<p>Version Control manages changes made to code, and also tags releases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each dev has a workspace (&quot;Local Repository&quot;)</li>
<li>There is also a shared workspace (&quot;Remote Repository&quot;)</li>
<li>Devs can make changes to their local repos</li>
<li>Changes can be synced between repos</li>
<li>&quot;Branches&quot; allow parallel development</li>
<li>Branches can be merged together</li>
</ul>
<h3>Git</h3>
<p>I have files. I make changes to them.</p>
<p>Git lets me record my changes. It puts each change (also called a diff or a delta) in a bucket, in order, like a history. Now I can undo changes!</p>
<p>Git lets me push/pull my &quot;stack of changes&quot; (a repo) to other people's stacks of changes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If two people have a FILE, and one of them makes a change, they can share that change with the other person</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since people aren't always around, or aren't always online (like my laptop while driving to school), it's nice to have a server somewhere. The server isn't a developer, but can keep track of our change stack. Now anyone can share changes at any time, and anyone else can grab those changes.</p>
<p>If people are working on different things, they can create <em>branches</em>. Branches are independent stacks of changes. There is typically a main branch (formerly called the master branch). When a &quot;feature branch&quot; is done, it can be <em>merged</em> back <em>into</em> the main branch.</p>
<p>When merging, if the changes in two branches change the same line of a file, you'll have to pick which change you want to apply to that line. This is what it means to <em>resolve merge conflicts</em>.</p>
<h3>Git Flow</h3>
<p>From the main branch, create <em>feature branches</em> for each user story.</p>
<p>When a feature branch is done, the developer should create a pull request to merge it back into main. A pull request is like a code review.</p>
<p>Once the changes are back into main, other feature branches should merge main into them, so that they are developing on top of the most recent version of the code.</p>
<h3>Avoiding Conflicts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep lines short</li>
<li>Keep commits small and focused</li>
<li>If multiple devs are working on the same branch:
<ul>
<li>Pull <em>all the time</em></li>
<li>Push <em>as often as possible</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a feature branch is taking a long time:
<ul>
<li>Merge in main, so that you're building on the most recent version</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The class advocates for deleting branches. I don't think this is a good idea, but such is life.</p>
