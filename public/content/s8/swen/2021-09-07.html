<p>What does stack overflow have to say about coupling and cohesion? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14000762/what-does-low-in-coupling-and-high-in-cohesion-mean</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's two design principles, SOLID and GRASP, that are commonly used.</p>
<p>SOLID:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Single Responsibility</em></li>
<li>Open/Closed</li>
<li>Liskov Substitution</li>
<li>Interface Segregation</li>
<li><em>Dependency Inversion</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Italics</em> items are covered today. We'll also hit <em>Law of Demeter</em>, and <em>High cohesion</em> and <em>low coupling</em> from GRASP.</p>
<h2>Single Responsibility</h2>
<p>An object should have one job. No &quot;god&quot; classes that do everything - no Swiss army knives.</p>
<p>Classes should be small, simple, focused, and numerous.</p>
<p>This helps a lot with team coordination and unit testing.</p>
<h2>High Cohesion</h2>
<p>The fields and methods of a class should be closely related. A class with too many responsibilities should be broken apart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This design goal should have a higher priority than the others&quot; - prof</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these tiny classes will need to interact. You will increase coupling by pursuing this goal - that's okay, to an extent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler&quot; - Einstein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some classes <em>will</em> be complex, and they should be - only break them if there are two jobs present.</p>
<h2>Information Expert</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Assign responsibility to the class that has the information needed to fulfill the responsibility&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Low Coupling</h2>
<p>This attempts to minimize the impact of changes in the system.</p>
<p>We want to minimize unnecessary coupling. There is a real balance here between number of classes and relationships between classes.</p>
<h2>Law of Demeter</h2>
<p>Limit the range of classes that a class talks to - essentially boils down to &quot;Only talk to your friends&quot;.</p>
<p>If you're doing <code>board.getPiece(x,y).getAttribute()</code>, you might not need to know about piece - try <code>board.getPieceAttributeAt(x,y)</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think this is kinda horrible, since board now needs &quot;getters&quot; for attributes of someone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Dependency Inversion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;High-level modules should rely only on abstractions (interfaces).&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Abstractions should not rely on details - details should rely on abstractions.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A &quot;copy&quot; object (a high-level module) should not depend on a keyboardReader or screenWriter, but a <code>Reader</code> abstraction and a <code>Writer</code> abstraction (interfaces) that these things implement.</p>
<h1>Administrative</h1>
<p>Do not come to class on Thursday! The lecture will be recorded and posted. Prof. will be available throughout the day to answer questions.</p>
<p>When the class site and myCourses disagree, use myCourses as the source of truth.</p>
