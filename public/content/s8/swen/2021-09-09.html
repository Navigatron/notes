<h1>Wed Sep 08 2021 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time):</h1>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>These are the earliest and most fundamental decisions. Your architecture choices will have huge impacts.</p>
<p>Architecture is influenced by non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):</p>
<ul>
<li>Operational
<ul>
<li>Scalability</li>
<li>Availability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Developmental
<ul>
<li>Testability</li>
<li>Portability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Constraints
<ul>
<li>Pre-chosen components (someDB)</li>
<li>Some framework</li>
<li>Stakeholder really wants X</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Architecture is guided by patterns, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failover / Load balancing</li>
<li>Model View Controler</li>
<li>Layers</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;No architecture is right or wrong, just more or less useful&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WebCheckers must be web based, using Spark and Freemaker.</p>
<p>Architecture is modeled using tiers.</p>
<ul>
<li>User interacts with UI</li>
<li>UI interacts with APP</li>
<li>APP interacts with DATA MODEL</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I personally would split that further, UI / Routes / Controllers / Services / Data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The model tier holds the business logic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That's just wrong. The data model should not have business logic. Maybe constraint checks at most.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The layers can be broken down:</p>
<ul>
<li>frameworks
<ul>
<li>like spark / freemarker</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Platform
<ul>
<li>like java</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OS/Hardware
<ul>
<li>like Windows / desktop</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For the quiz, you will need this word: &quot;Elaboration&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Sprint Planning</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A sprint plan is a plan to build a small working increment of a product.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Typically 3 weeks long, a sprint is a commitment to the product owner.</p>
<p>The sprint planning meeting is what creates the sprint plan.</p>
<p>The product backlog holds a number of stories. Each has a level of effort, which the team decides on. During the plan meeting, stories are moved from the product backlog to the sprint backlog.</p>
<p>Effort is measured in points. If a team can do 25 points of work in a sprint, then we pull in stories until we have that many points assigned.</p>
<p>Stories could fit into the sprint point-wise, but might need to be left out based on dependencies or purposes. Best judgement applies.</p>
<p>How do you know when you're done with a story?</p>
<p>Establish criteria for &quot;Definition of Done&quot; - Acceptance Criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li>Define acceptance criteria</li>
<li>Design solution</li>
<li>Develop solution - &quot;code complete&quot;</li>
<li>Test the feature manually</li>
</ul>
<p>Other things we'll hit later:</p>
<ul>
<li>feature branches</li>
<li>unit testing</li>
<li>code coverage?</li>
<li>Pull requests / code reviews?</li>
<li>Demonstrations?</li>
</ul>
<p>The many transitions and states:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product Backlog
<ul>
<li>Advance when acceptance criteria are defined, and makes sense in the sprint</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sprint backlog
<ul>
<li>Advance when someone starts working on it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Development
<ul>
<li>Advance when dev is done</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ready for Test
<ul>
<li>Advance when someone starts testing it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Test
<ul>
<li>Advance when testing is complete - passes acceptance criteria</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Done</li>
</ul>
<p>The sprint board - trello - tells us the status of all work.</p>
<p>If you have too much going on, a dropped story <em>should</em> go back to the product backlog.</p>
<p>The number of points your team can do in a sprint is called the <em>velocity</em>.</p>
<p>Your velocity should be a rolling average of the <em>completed</em> points of the last three sprints.</p>
<p>Velocity is a <em>metric</em> - a measurement - you cannot declare a board to be some length, and you cannot declare the velocity of a team. Since velocity is a measurement of a single team on a single project, and point levels are estimated, velocities <em>cannot</em> be compared between teams.</p>
<p>Life impacts how much a team can actually handle. The rolling average will smooth over most things, but teams <em>can</em> manually scale down if needed.</p>
