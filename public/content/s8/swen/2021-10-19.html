<p>Today: How to make a presentation</p>
<p>Peer Reviews come out today, due at midnight!</p>
<p>Sprint 2 should be well underway. Presentations will be done in-class.
4 groups on day 1, 4 groups on day 2.
You don't have to come on a day if you're not presenting.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Making a good presentation</h2>
<p>You know more information than you have time to present - Prioritize!</p>
<p>Don't be bad. Be good, by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using voice inflection</li>
<li>Keeping it interesting</li>
<li>Practice!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sequence Diagram</h2>
<p>Objects go at the top, in a rectangle. The line coming down from them represents time.</p>
<p>A <em>Class</em> is typically prefixed by a colon.</p>
<p>To represent an Object that is an instance of a class, use <code>Object:Class</code>, read as &quot;&lt;Object&gt; of [type] &lt;Class&gt;&quot;, ex apple of type fruit.</p>
<p>All the &quot;characters&quot; in the story go across the top. The lines coming down are called &quot;lifelines&quot;.</p>
<p>Diagrams are read from top down, and typically start on the left side - therefore, the top left corner. From there, we follow the lifelines down and see all the interactions between the characters in order.</p>
<p>Creation looks like <code>&lt;&lt;create&gt;&gt;</code>, while a function call with an argument might look like <code>method1(object3)</code>.</p>
<p>Boxes can be super-imposed over a sequence diagram to indicate loops or other alternative conditions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All &quot;alt&quot; conditions should have the same <em>entry</em> and <em>exit</em> state. If a line is &quot;on&quot; going into an alt, it must be on coming out of it, and the same in all other alts of the same group.</p>
