<h1>Groundwork and Discrete Probability</h1>
<h2>Set Theory</h2>
<p>A capital letter denotes a set. Sets are collections of... stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers</li>
<li>Strings</li>
<li>Shoe Sizes</li>
<li>Shoes</li>
<li>Whatever, physical or symbolic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below, the set $$A$$ contains some numbers.</p>
<p>$$ A = { 5, 10, 15, 20, 2 } $$</p>
<p>There are some symbols involved for operations.</p>
<table>
<thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>$$X \in A$$</td>
<td>Element Of</td>
<td>X is a thing in set A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$$A \subset B$$</td>
<td>Subset</td>
<td>A is a subset of B. If it's in A, it must be in B.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$$A \cup B$$</td>
<td>Union</td>
<td>Set of all things in A or B. Give me Both.</td>

<td>Set of things in both A and B. The Overlap part of the Venn-Diagram</td>

<h3>Probability</h3>
<p>Sets contain possible outcomes. In flipping a coin, there are two possible outcomes: Heads, and Tails.</p>
<p>$$ Flip = {Heads, Tails}$$</p>
<p>Sets in probability are <em>Evaluated</em>. When the experiment is performed, we get a result. The Probability that Set F (for flip) evaluates to Heads is as follows:</p>
<p>$$P(F = Heads)$$</p>
<p>The set of ping-pong balls in the lottery machine contains the numbers 1 to 30. You've bet on 7.</p>
<p>$$P(L = 7) = \frac {1} {30}$$</p>
<h2>Axioms of Probability</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Probability of an Event is Greater than or Equal to Zero.</p>
<p>$$P(A) \geq 1$$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Probability of Everything is 1.</p>
<p>$$P(\varepsilon) = 1$$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The probability of something in a group occurring, is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each thing.</p>
<p>$$P(\cup_{k}A_{k}) = \Sigma P(A_{k})$$</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The last one is a <em>little</em> confusing. Take the union of a bunch of things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combine all our little sets... INTO A <strong>SUPER SET.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just the same as adding them all together - <em>As long as they don't overlap.</em></p>
<h2>Conditional Probability</h2>
<p>$A$ and $B$ are possible events. They could both happen, or maybe only one. If B has already happened, What's the probability that A will also happen?</p>
<p>The following is read as &quot;The Probability of $A$ given $B$.&quot;</p>
<p>$$P(A | B)$$</p>
<p>You're falling from the sky. You're going to land in B. What's the probability that you also land in A? Think of it as Overlap of A and B divided by total area of B.</p>
<p>In fancy notation, it looks like this:</p>
<p>$$P(A | B) = \frac {P(A \cap B)} {P(B)}$$</p>
<h2>Magic Formulas</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Probability that something will happen Plus the Probability that it wont Equals One. It either will or wont, there's no other option.</p>
<p>$$P(A)+P(A^k)=1$$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>A Union B</code> equals <code>A+B-overlap</code>. Don't count the overlap twice.</p>
<p>$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If B is only defined in relation to A, use this.</p>
<p>$$P(B)=P(X\cap A)+P(X\cap A^c)$$</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's worth noting that $A^c$ is &quot;A Complement&quot;, or the probability that a <em>won't</em> happen, aka $1-P(A)$</p>
<h2>Discrete Probability - PMF</h2>
<p>PMF = Probability Mass Function</p>
<p>For Discrete Probability (drawing from a set), this is more of a lookup table than a function.</p>
<p>Sum of two coin flips (heads=1, tails=0):</p>

<th>$P(event)$</th>

<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>$\frac {1} {4}$</td>

<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>$\frac {1} {2}$</td>

<h2>Expectation</h2>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>The Weighted average of all possible outcomes. The weights are the probabilities of the outcome.</p>
<p>$$E(X)=\Sigma (xP(X=x))$$</p>
<p>A function of a random variable evaluates to... a random variable. Fortunately, it's the same idea.</p>
<p>$$E(g(X))=\Sigma (g(x)P(X=x))$$</p>
<p>What is $E(X^2)$? Think of it as $E(g(x))$, where $g(x)=x^2$</p>
<p>$$E(X^2)=\Sigma (x^2*P(X=x))$$</p>
<h3>Mean</h3>
<p>The Mean is what you expect the results to be on average. This greek letter is pronounced &quot;mew&quot;.</p>
<p>$$\mu = E(X)$$</p>
<h3>Variance</h3>
<p>Take each Data Point, find it's distance from the center. Square it. Find the expectation of that.</p>
<p>Variance tells you how far data points will be, on average, from the mean.</p>
<p>Hard but understandable:</p>
<p>$$V(X)=E((X-\mu)^2)$$</p>
<p>Simplified:</p>
<p>$$V(X)=E(X^2)-(E(X))^2$$</p>
