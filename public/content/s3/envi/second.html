<h1>Bamboo</h1>
<h2>What is Bamboo?</h2>
<p>Bamboo is a plant that grows tall and fast - but what else?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/bamboo">Encyclopedia Britannica - Bamboo</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Bamboo is a tree-like grass, comprising of 1400+ species</li>
<li>Typically found in tropical to mild temperate regions</li>
<li>More heavily concentrated in East and Southeast Asia</li>
<li>Some species grow up to 1 foot per day</li>
<li>Stems, or <em>culms</em>, range from 4cm to 40m</li>
</ul>
<h2>Can bamboo absorb CO2?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.ecology.com/2013/05/15/what-can-bamboo-do-about-co2/">Ecology.com - Bamboo and CO2</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Bamboo is better at removing CO2 from the atmosphere than trees.
<ul>
<li>While smaller, it grows much faster.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One hectare of Moso bamboo can remove 5.1 tons of carbon</li>
<li>Bamboo can be used as a building material</li>
<li>Bamboo's root system re-grows culms as soon as they are harvested</li>
</ul>
<h2>Carbon -&gt; Bamboo, then what?</h2>
<p>The above article hints that bamboo can be used as a building material, replacing
building materials that may be less environmentally friendly.</p>
<h2>Bamboo Structures and Physical strength</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/stronger-steel-85533">Newsweek - Bamboo</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Bamboo has a greater tensile strength than steel</li>
<li>And greater compressive strength than concrete</li>
<li>Bamboo makes higher quality plywood</li>
<li>Bamboo produces 35% more O2 from CO2 than trees</li>
<li>Bamboo's root system is better at stabilizing soil than trees
<ul>
<li>This reduces erosion</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bamboo as a building material</h2>
<p><a href="https://theconstructor.org/building/bamboo-as-a-building-material-uses-advantages/14838/">Bamboo as Building Material</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Bamboo must be dried, boiled, or chemically treated to avoid rot</li>
<li>Bamboo quickly degrades when in prolonged contact with moisture</li>
<li>Bamboo joinery is difficult, with questionable structural reliability</li>
<li>Bamboo shrinks more than any other timber as it looses water</li>
<li>Despite this, bamboo remains a very popular building material in the areas
where it is very common
<ul>
<li>It is unlikely to replace concrete or steel in significant amounts in the US</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bamboo pulp for paper</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/ghgrp-pulp-and-paper">EPA pulp and paper CO2 emissions</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The pulp and paper industry released between 20 and 30 million metric tons of CO2
in 2017</li>
<li>It is unclear weather using bamboo pulp would decrease CO2 emissions over
other organic matter</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusions so far:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bamboo absorbs more CO2 from the air than trees</li>
<li>In the eastern hemisphere, bamboo is used for rural construction</li>
<li>In the western hemisphere, It is unclear what bamboo may be used for
<ul>
<li>While more environmentally friendly, it has disadvantages in terms of
durability and stability when compared to concrete or steel</li>
<li>Use for paper production is also unlikely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>A closer look at carbon absorbtion</h2>
<p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-06-trees-bamboos-halves-carbon-storage.html">Phys.org</a></p>
<p>Phys.org cites the following:</p>
<pre><code>Zaninovich S.C, L.F. Montti, M.F. Alvarez, M.G. Gatti. 2017. Replacing trees by
	bamboos: Changes from canopy to soil organic carbon storage. Forest Ecology
	and Management 400: 208-217. DOI: 10.1016/j.foreco.2017.05.047
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Bamboo produces lower-quality leaf litter than trees, resulting in increased
leaf-littler-layer depth.
<ul>
<li>Decomposers have a more difficult time decomposing bamboo leaf litter</li>
<li>The leaf litter layer can double in depth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;The soil contains more carbon than the atmosphere and the vegetation&quot;</li>
<li>Leaf litter prevents soil from absorbing carbon</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bamboo forests can absorb more CO2 than regular forests, however, CO2 storage
capacity is decreased due to the difficulty with which bamboo leaf litter
is decomposed.</p>
<p>Bamboo is not likely to replace modern products, and will not improve CO2
sequestering of existing forests.</p>
<p>However, bamboo is significantly better than nothing, and will vastly
improve CO2 absorbtion of hostile environments, such as rocky terrain or
other areas where plant life is scarce.</p>
