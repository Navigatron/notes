<h1>Video - Watch the US stall on climate change for 12 years</h1>
<ul>
<li>Climate change used to be a bi-partisan issue, everyone was on board</li>
<li>This is no longer the case</li>
</ul>
<h1>PowerPoint - &quot;The Best Solution to Global Warming&quot; - Citizen's Climate Lobby</h1>
<p>Citizen's Climate Lobby believes the gov can and should work.</p>
<p>At the point of extraction, where the fuel enters the economy, charge a
$100 fee per ton of Carbon. This charges coal more than oil, and oil more than gas.</p>
<p>Fee, not a tax - &quot;Taxes are evil&quot;, taxes create programs. Fee goes directly
back into US households.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, oil prices go up. This is fine, households have extra cash to compensate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, renewable energy gets cheaper.</p>
<p>Houses will likely be more incentivized to purchase renewable energy.</p>
<p>Cost of inaction, cost of catastrophe, will continue to rise. By taking action
the cost of catastrophe can be kept lower - implementing this policy is fiscally responsible.</p>
<h2>Imports</h2>
<p>imported things from other countries would pay a tariff at the border</p>
<h2>Track Record</h2>
<p>British Columbia, province in Canada, implemented similar law. Very successful.</p>
<h2>Economic impact</h2>
<p>CCL paid REMI to analyze impact of proposal</p>
<ul>
<li>create many jobs.</li>
<li>Carbon emissions way down</li>
<li>Household dividend to reach $350/month in 2025? (had we started in 2015)</li>
</ul>
