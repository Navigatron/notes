<h1>Housekeeping</h1>
<ul>
<li>Need to have read through chapter 8 in Living downstream</li>
<li>Need to catch-up on... lots of things</li>
<li>2 essays due by the end of the month.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: In the book report, use the two books as resources for a separate argument</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Environmental Disease Day One</h1>
<p><em>What are mutations?</em></p>
<p>mutagen - increases rate of genetic change</p>
<p>teratogen - substances that cause harm to a growing embryo or fetus</p>
<p>carcinogen - something that causes cancer</p>
<p>about 2% of cancers are genetic - there are strong environmental ties.</p>
<p>mutations in somatic cells are not inherited - mutations in germ cells are passed directly to future generations.</p>
<p>Point mutations
- Simple Substitution, T-&gt;C
- Addition - drop another one in there - caused a frame shift, because codons are read in groups of 3.
- Deletion - also causes a fame shift</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note - December 4th - Frame shifts are pretty remarkable. Codons in DNA are read in groups of 3, and
each one becomes an amino acid in a protein. Take this: &quot;CAT YES GOO BRO DOG&quot;, and frame shift it.
&quot;ATY ESG OOB ROD OGC&quot; - that makes no sense. Worse yet, this disrupts start and stop codons, which basically wreck
the mRNA transcription process. In short, a frame shift pretty much disables the creation of whatever protein this
part of the DNA was for. For more on pre-mRNA, I built <a href="https://navigatron.github.io/nowaymrna/">This</a> for Bio 101.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Translocation</h2>
<p>when some DNA exchanges a piece with another bit of DNA.</p>
<h2>non-disjunction</h2>
<p>chomosomes don't separate perfectly during cell division - one cell has an extra, and one cell has one missing.</p>
