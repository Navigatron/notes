<h1>Housekeeping</h1>
<ul>
<li>Friday after career fair alternate assignment</li>
<li>Last Friday alternate assignment</li>
<li>First essay should be in within 7 days</li>
</ul>
<h1>Toxicology</h1>
<h2>Exposure Pathways</h2>
<p>Eating mercury is almost fine. Inhaling fumes is highly toxic.</p>
<h2>Exposure Duration</h2>
<p>A lot over a short time vs a little all the time for a long time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<ul>
<li>1976 - Toxic Substances Control Act
<ul>
<li>Already using, fine.</li>
<li>New things should be tested</li>
<li>Since inception, has banned ~12 chemicals</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Susceptibility</h2>
<p>varies a lot by many different factors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dose makes the Poison<br>
Timing also makes the poison.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Implies that small enough amounts are okay. Things that unbalance the
endocrine system are pretty significant.</p>
<p>Exposure may not impact the individual, but the individuals offspring.</p>
<h2>Environmental Toxcicity</h2>
<p>After we're done with them, they go somewhere.</p>
<p>POPS - persistent organic [something] [something]</p>
<p>Liver, heart, kidney, lungs - fatty organs bio-accumulate fat soluble toxins.</p>
<h2>PCBs</h2>
<p>2 carbon rings surrounded by chlorine. Swedish researchers in 1964 found PCBs
<em>everywhere</em>. Deep sea trenches, polar bears, birds, all over.</p>
<p>PCBS are endocrine disruptors, along with many other things.</p>
<p>1 and 2 plastics are intended for single use - the plastic breaks down. Leaks
phthlates - bad stuff I guess.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note - December 4th - &quot;Phthalate&quot; - a plasticizer. These things are everywhere. Some act as endocrine disruptors. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phthalate">Wikipedia has basic info</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is pretty clear evidence that endocrine disruptors are causing birth defects.</p>
