<h1>Alternative Cement</h1>
<h2>What is concrete made of?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.concreteconstruction.net/how-to/what-concrete-is-made-of_o">Concrete Construction.net - What concrete is made of</a></p>
<p>Concrete is made of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coarse aggregate, usually Gravel</li>
<li>Fine aggregate, usually Sand</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Portland Cement</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Portland cement made of?</h2>
<p><a href="https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/05/09/emissions-from-the-cement-industry/">Cement Production Emissions, by the Earth Institute at Columbia University</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Limestone and Clay are heated to create Clinker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clinker and gypsum are combined to make cement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Producing one ton of cement:</p>
<ul>
<li>requires 4.7 million BTU
<ul>
<li>400 lbs of coal equivalent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Produces 1 ton of CO2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When limestone is heated, it undergoes calcination</p>
<ul>
<li>Calcium carbonate Breaks down into calcium oxide and CO2.</li>
<li>This accounts for 50% of the cement industries CO2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heating kilns to 1400C accounts for 40% of the cement industries CO2.</p>
<ul>
<li>The remaining 10% comes from vehicles, machinery, electricity for lights, and other such sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>More background info on the chemical process</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/resource/res00000704/thermal-decomposition-of-calcium-carbonate?cmpid=CMP00005970">Royal Society of Chemistry - Calcium Carbonate Calcination</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Calcium carbonate breaks down into Calcium Oxide and Carbon Dioxide
<ul>
<li>(CaCO3 + Heat -&gt; CaO + CO2)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Cement Manufacturing process from Illinois.edu</h2>
<p><a href="http://matse1.matse.illinois.edu/concrete/prin.html">Cement Production</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Limestone, Clay / Shale, Sand, and Iron Ore go into the kiln together</li>
<li>&quot;Clinker&quot; comes out of the kiln</li>
<li>Small amounts of gypsum are added to regulate setting</li>
<li>The final product, Ground clinker + gypsum, is Portland Cement.</li>
<li>Mixing water with portland cement causes the cement to bind together aggregate
<ul>
<li>This is a chemical reaction, concrete does not need to dry</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By weight, Portland cement is roughly:
<ul>
<li>50% Tricalcium Silicate
<ul>
<li>Which provides most of the strength in the first 7 days of curing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>25% Dicalcium Silicate
<ul>
<li>Which cures much more slowly, but is much stronger</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hydration Formula (Direct Quote)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Tricalcium silicate + Water ---&gt; Calcium silicate hydrate+Calcium hydroxide + heat

2 Ca3SiO5 + 7 H2O ---&gt; 3 CaO.2SiO2.4H2O + 3 Ca(OH)2 + 173.6kJ
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Calcium Silicate Hydrate crystals begin forming on the aggregate, and continue
to grow until all liquid areas have been replaced and the mixture is solid.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Side note</h2>
<p>The article from Illinois.edu mentions SuperPlasticizers - My mother works in the
concrete industry, and describes &quot;Super-P&quot; as a &quot;soapy, slippery substance&quot; that
replaces water and greatly increases the strength of concrete.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.buildingresearch.com.np/newfeatures.php">here</a>,
Super plasticizers can make up 0.5% to 3% of concrete by weight, and eliminate
the need for up to 40% of water.</p>
<p>I'm finding no hard information relating super-plasticizer additives to
human health after a quick search, though this will be an interesting topic to
pursue later.</p>
<h2>Conclusion so far</h2>
<p>Limestone (Calcium Carbonate) from the ground is separated into an ingredient for cement
and CO2.</p>
<h2>How much CO2 does this produce?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www3.epa.gov/ttnchie1/conference/ei13/ghg/hanle.pdf">CO2 Emissions profile of the US Cement Industry</a></p>
<p>The above article provides lots of information.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the year 2000
<ul>
<li>&quot;Global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from cement production were approximately
829 million metric tons of CO2&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In 2001, Coal accounted for 71% of the energy used by cement production in the US</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the alternatives?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.us-concrete.com/sustainability/ef-technology/">us-concrete.com</a></p>
<p>The above website is a concrete supplier, and does not cite any sources for the
information they present. Below, I present more sources that back up these claims.</p>
<h3>Fly Ash</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fly ash is a byproduct of coal-burning electric generating stations</li>
<li>Fly ash used to be disposed of in landfills</li>
<li>Fly ash can replace up to 50% of the Portland cement in concrete</li>
<li>Fly ash concrete produces less heat when curing, which is very beneficial when
building large structures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Slag</h3>
<ul>
<li>Impurities removed from melting metal</li>
<li>Can replace up to 50% of Portland cement</li>
</ul>
<p>Combined, Slag and Fly ash can replace up to 80% of the Portland cement in concrete</p>
<h2>More sources for the above</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cement.org/docs/default-source/fc_concrete_technology/is548-optimizing-the-use-of-fly-ash-concrete.pdf">Optimizing Fly Ash</a></p>
<p>The Portland Cement Association released the above publication, detailing
the exact amounts of Fly ash to use when aiming for a certain goal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.slagcement.org/aboutslagcement/whatisslagcement.aspx">What Is Slag Cement?</a></p>
<p>Similar to the Portland Cement Association, there is a Slag Cement Association,
which confirms the data above.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The cement industry produces 5% of humanities CO2 emissions. Up to 80% of cement
can be replaced by Fly ash and Slag, which are wastes of other industries
(Energy and Metallurgy respectively) that would otherwise end in a landfill.</p>
<p>In addition to reducing CO2 emissions, Making cement with fly ash and slag
results in stronger, more durable, more chemically resistant concrete.</p>
