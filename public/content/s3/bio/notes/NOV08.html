	<h1>Housekeeping</h1>
<ul>
<li>Homework this sunday</li>
<li>Something about quizzes</li>
<li>media project due in 8 days</li>
</ul>
<h1>Biology 101 Lecture, november 8th</h1>
<ul>
<li>Genetic Drift
<ul>
<li>bottleneck
<ul>
<li>Loose half the population due to catastrophic event</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Founder effect
<ul>
<li>colonizing mars</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In decreasing the gene pool, some alleles may go extinct.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nonrandom mating
<ul>
<li>Some individuals reproduce more often than others</li>
<li>intersexual competition - one gender is &quot;choosy&quot;</li>
<li>intrasexual competition - competition to mate, such as deer fighting each other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and then, natural selection</p>
<p>promotes survival and reproductive success in a specific environment</p>
<p>Zebras are black and white - and lions are colorblind.</p>
<p>Three modes of natural selection</p>
<ul>
<li>Stabilizing selection - distribution becomes narrower</li>
<li>Directional selection - push the distribution to one direction</li>
<li>Disruptive selection - remove the center, push to two different extremes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chapter 14 - Macroevolution</h2>
<ul>
<li>What is a species?
<ul>
<li>a collection that can interbreed to produce fertile offspring, roughly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When there's a barrier, dividing a population, speciation may occur.</p>
<p>Sympatric speciation - fruit flies that hatch later feed on a different type of apple tree, and breed with each other.</p>
<p>polyploidy - different plants breed to create new plants - most of these are not fertile due to mismatched chromosomes - an error in meiosis that makes each have the same number however can create a new sustainable species.</p>
<p>The below is different from common ancestor traits, like the 1-2-5 bone structure in the arms of many animals.</p>
<p>Analogous Structures - convergent evolution - multiple species evolve towards a similar shape. (Sharks and penguins are both torpedo shape)</p>
<p>Cladistics - how many traits do two species have in common - A clade is a group of similar species</p>
