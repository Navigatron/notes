<h2>Flow Control</h2>
<p>Flow control prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver.</p>
<p>&quot;Sliding window&quot; is TCP's flow control mechanism.</p>
<p>The window size on the sender is determined by available buffer space on receiver.</p>
<h3>Sliding Window</h3>
<p>Sender does not have to send a full segment - source can send what they've got
at any time.</p>
<p>The receiver can decide at any time to increase or decrease the sender's window
size. This is accomplished though specific TCP flags.</p>
<p>Bytes in the window are sent from left to right. As the ones on the left are
acked, the window slides to the right, revealing more bytes to send.</p>
<h3>Silly Window Syndrome</h3>
<p>Consider typing in a terminal emulator over ssh. Each keystroke generates
1 byte. Sending 1 byte takes 58 bytes of overhead, which is silly.</p>
<p>Either the sender has small data, or the receiver can't process fast enough. In
either case, the sender is sending very small pieces, which is inefficient.</p>
<h4>Nagle's Algorithm</h4>
<ol>
<li>Send the first byte</li>
<li>Wait until one of two conditions is true:
<ul>
<li>I have an mss of data</li>
<li>I receive an ACK from that first byte</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Clark's Solution</h4>
<p>Consider a receiver that has broadcast a window size of zero.</p>
<p>If the receiver sends small window sizes, silly window syndrome occurs.</p>
<p>Clark's solution says to keep sending a window size of zero until either:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have enough buffer to receive an MSS</li>
<li>My buffer is now 50% free</li>
</ul>
<h4>Delayed Ack</h4>
<p>Delaying ACKS reduces the amount of traffic - but we must avoid unnecessary
re-transmissions.</p>
<h2>Error Control</h2>
<h3>Checksum</h3>
<p>Checksums verify data integrity. Corrupted segments are thrown away, treated the
same as lost segments.</p>
<h3>Acks</h3>
<p>Acks let the sender know that the message was received.</p>
<p>Cumulative acks ack continuous, contiguous chunks of data.</p>
<p>Selective acks allow the acking of non-in-order segments.</p>
<ul>
<li>This moves less data, though it sends more acks.</li>
<li>Uses the TCP options field</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting thing - Later Acks help recover from earlier acks if RTO hasn't happened yet.</p>
<h3>Time-Out</h3>
<p>If the data gets lost, or the ack gets lost on the way back, the RTO kicks in.</p>
<p>RTO tells us to re-transmit data if we don't hear back within a timeframe.</p>
<h4>Fast RT</h4>
<p>If we're using cumulative ACKs and we get 3 acks in a row for the same data,
we re-transmit that data.</p>
<h2>Congestion Control</h2>
<p>When network load is greater than network capacity, there is congestion.</p>
