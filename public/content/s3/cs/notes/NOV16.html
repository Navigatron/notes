<h1>Housekeeping</h1>
<ul>
<li>Experiment 7 due Monday, 11:59PM</li>
<li>Project
<ul>
<li>Early submission Tuesday, 11:59PM</li>
<li>On-Time: Monday the 26th, arrival back from break.</li>
<li>Late: Tuesday the 27th, 11:59PM</li>
<li>The program must pass build and link, in order for try to save it.</li>
<li>It's possible to get a 40% with only input and output. <em>Make sure try saves what you submit - Pass build and link using any method needed. Comment out everything. Jump to end. Whatever it takes - Give Phil something to grade.</em></li>
<li>New submissions delete old submissions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Register File Circuit</h1>
<p>Inside, there are 32 32-bit registers. Each register has two inputs, LOAD, and IN - in is a 32-bit number. Each register has one output, OUT, which is a 32-bit number.</p>
<p>Send load to a register and it'll remember whatever is on IN. A register always outputs what it's remembering.</p>
<p>Copy/Paste of the register file block diagram from my last notes:</p>
<pre><code>MIPS 32x32bit register file
   +--------------+
 5-|RA1           |
 5-|RA2         R1|-32
  -|Write         |
 5-|WA          R2|-32
32-|Wdata         |
   |              |
   +--------------+
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>RA1 - which register goes to R1</li>
<li>RA2 - which register goes to R2</li>
<li>Write - single bit flag, 1=write, 0=do nothing.</li>
<li>WA - which register to write to, if we're writing</li>
<li>Wdata - The value to be written to a register, if we're writing.</li>
<li>R1 - output from a register, RA1 decides which one</li>
<li>R2 - output from another register, RA2 decides which one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's how we get these inputs and outputs to and from the actual registers inside the register file.</p>
<p><code>Wdata</code>, the data to write, goes everywhere - because the registers won't do anything with it. We can send the <code>Write</code> flag to only the register we want to write to.</p>
<p><code>WA</code>, aka Write Address, decides what register we want to send the <code>Write</code> flag to. A Decoder takes a number and outputs one flag. <code>WA</code> goes into a 5-to-32 decoder, which has an output for every register, tied to the register's <code>LOAD</code>.</p>
<p>So far, <code>Wdata</code> goes everywhere. <code>WA</code> goes through a decoder to trigger the correct register to read the <code>Wdata</code>. However, sometimes we do not want to write to a register. If the <code>Write</code> flag is off, we do not want to write - the <code>Write</code> input to the register file goes to the Enable input of the decoder.</p>
<p>Now reading.</p>
<p>It's time for a big-ass, very special multiplexer. For now, we'll pretend each register only outputs 1 bit.</p>
<p>Use <code>RA1</code> as the 5-bit select on the MUX. Each register is a data input to the MUX. The output of the MUX goes to register file output R1.</p>
<p>What if each register output 2 bits? All we need is another 32bit MUX.</p>
<p>And then another. Anotha one. Anotha one. Anotha one. Until there are 32 multiplexers, each one picking 1 bit from each register, and sending it to output 1.</p>
<p>Output2 is another 32 multiplexers.</p>
<p>In logisim, it's so much easier - multiplexers can take multi-bit wires.</p>
<h1>CPU</h1>
<p>A cpu is made of a control unit, and a data path.</p>
<p>The Control unit decides:</p>
<ol>
<li>What to do</li>
<li>When to do it</li>
<li>What data to use</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions 1 and 3 are answered by the instruction. Question 2 is harder - Things need to happen in order.</p>
<p>The Data Path:</p>
<ol>
<li>Moves data around (Busses!)</li>
<li>Manipulates Data (ALU and some dark magic)</li>
<li>Stores the data (Registers)</li>
</ol>
<p>The data path sends some things to the control unit - instructions read from memory, and results from branches.</p>
