<h1>Housekeeping</h1>
<ul>
<li>Project 1 exists</li>
<li>Homework 6 is up, due next wednesday probably</li>
</ul>
<h1>PLAs</h1>
<p>A PLA has a lot of inputs into an AND array. Outputs from the AND array are fed into an OR array.</p>
<p>Every gate in every array is attached to every input via fuses. To program a PLA, we apply high voltage to burn out specific fuses.</p>
<p>PLAs are very small, very cheap to produce, and fit together really well. PLAs are tasty.</p>
<h2>ICs</h2>
<p>An Integrated Circuit is like a PLA - but all the wires that wouldn't be used are never put in in the first place.
It looks like a PLA without any un-used circuits. ICs are cheaper and more efficient is massive numbers.</p>
<p>So, In general:</p>
<ul>
<li>PLAs for small batches of products</li>
<li>ICs for huge batches</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hard Left Turn -&gt; ROM (Read Only memory)</h2>
<p>You can't write to that.</p>
<p>ROM takes an address, and gives some data. That data doesn't change - Aha! It's a Truth Table!</p>
<p>It's a Truth table? It's a 2-level circuit! It's a PLA!</p>
<p>oh no.</p>
<h1>Sequential Circuits</h1>
<p>A combinational circuit and memory</p>
<p>One of the inputs is from memory, and one of the outputs is to the same memory.</p>
<p>Output is based on input + saved state.</p>
<h2>Our first sequential circuit</h2>
<p>Inverter 1 goes to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Output (lightbulb)</li>
<li>And the input of Inverter 1.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asynch sequential circuit</h3>
<p>An async seq circuit is continuously sampling it's input</p>
<p>This is rough, and really isn't good for all that much.</p>
<h3>Synchronous Sequential Ciruits</h3>
<p>A control system tells sequential components when to smaple their inputs</p>
<p>All modern computers use synchronous sequential systems.</p>
<h3>The Clock Wave</h3>
<p>The CPU Clock generates a Square^tm Wave</p>
<h3>Triggering</h3>
<p>What identifiable part of the square wave will we use to say &quot;Sample Input Now!&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Rising / leading edge</li>
<li>Falling / Trailing edge</li>
<li>level</li>
</ul>
<p>Rule - You are not allowed to change input while it is being sampled</p>
<ul>
<li>This creates &quot;Hold Time&quot; - the time you are not allowed to change the input.</li>
<li>Other time is &quot;Setup Time&quot; - During the setup time, we can change inputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Propagation delay takes place during the setup time, while circuits are running.</p>
<p>Circuits are really easy to build if we use level triggering - but then the clock cycle time is double the longest propagation delay.</p>
<p>Edge triggering takes more gates, but allows very very small hold time, almost doubling the clock speed.</p>
