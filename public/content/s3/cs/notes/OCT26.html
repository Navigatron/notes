<h1>Housekeeping</h1>
<ul>
<li>Project 1 exists</li>
<li>Lab 6 not yet released</li>
</ul>
<h1>Circuits</h1>
<p>Electricity moving through a wire is slowed down by resistance.</p>
<p>Resistance is based mainly on heat, and wire diameter.</p>
<p>Electricity travels about half the speed of light.</p>
<p>Circuit time is based on wire time and propagation time.</p>
<p>Wire time is just the time through the wires.</p>
<p>Propagation time is the time it takes for output to be stable after inputs are
introduced.</p>
<p>The circuit has a propagation time, as do all components / gates.</p>
<p>In this class, we're going to ignore wire length.</p>
<h2>Levels of a circuit</h2>
<p>The maximum number of gates the input has to travel through to make it to the
output.</p>
<p>Note - we ignore inverters.</p>
<p>levels of a circuit is a very very rough estimation of how long a circuit will
take.</p>
<p>We won't do simplification - simplification involves decreasing the levels of a
circuit so that it may run faster.</p>
<h2>Standard Forms</h2>
<p>Any function can be converted into one of two standard forms.</p>
<h3>Sum Of Product (SOP) [we'll use this one mostly]</h3>
<ul>
<li>An expression that uses only product terms and ors them together</li>
<li>At most two levels</li>
<li><code>F= {\bar A} AND B OR {\bar A} AND B AND C</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Product of Sum (POS)</h3>
<ul>
<li>pretty much the same thing as above, but flip the order.</li>
<li>Expression of sum terms anded together</li>
</ul>
<h3>minterms and maxterms</h3>
<p>A minterm is a product term with every variable in problem is either
complemented or uncomplemented. <code>A AND B AND C; {\bar A} AND B AND C</code></p>
<p>a maxterm is a sum term with all the vars in either complemented or
uncomplemented form. <code>A OR {\bar B} OR C</code></p>
<p>minterms and maxterms are a stepping stone to turn any function into a SOP
function.</p>
<h2>Truth Tables</h2>
<p>In the world, truth tables are way too unrestricted. In this class, there are
rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inputs listed in alphabetical order.
<ul>
<li>As long as the variables are independent.</li>
<li>Otherwise, leave em in the order of the most sense.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>List values in base 2 order.</li>
</ul>
<p>A | B | C | !A AND B AND C | !A AND B AND !C | minterm 1 OR minterm 2 | Minterm that owns this row
---|---
0|0|0|0|0|0
0|0|1|0|0|0
0|1|0|0|1|1
0|1|1|1|0|1
1|0|0|0|0|0
1|0|1|0|0|0
1|1|0|0|0|0
1|1|1|0|0|0</p>
<p>Every row corresponds to a minterm. By ORing minterms, we can create any function output by ORing minterms.</p>
<p>This creates a large upsetting function expression - this is where simplificaiton would come in if we were going to worry about that.</p>
<p>&quot;Carnomap&quot;s are the magic of how simplification happens.</p>
<p>Maxterms, or an OR of inputs, are zero for only one row. similar logic as above applies.</p>
<p>Result: Anything is a two-level circuit.</p>
