<h1>Alignment</h1>
<p>Memory is like an array of bytes - its very hard to control which bytes we're reading.</p>
<p>Solution: Don't get individual byte control. Memory is stored in 4byte groups.</p>
<p>To read 4 bytes, if the bytes are stored at a +0, that's one read.</p>
<p>If the stuff is at a+2, then it takes two reads.</p>
<p>Compilers put data at good locations.</p>
<h1>Data Alignment Defenition</h1>
<p>a piece of data is aligned if addr%len==0</p>
<p>If data is aligned, it can be accessed in the minimum number of memory calls.</p>
<p>If we try and read/write to an un-aligned address, rsim will give us an error.</p>
<h1>Three Load Instructions</h1>
<p><code>lw</code> - Load Word
<code>lh</code> - Load Half Word
<code>lb</code> - Load Byte</p>
<p>Words are typically the width of the bus.</p>
<p>Ints are at least as big as a short, which is at least as big as a byte, which is 8 bits.</p>
<p>C wanted everyone to use ints. Ints are typically as long as a word. This causes problems.</p>
<p>If you turn on backwards compatibility on all x86 C compilers, you get 16bit ints.</p>
<p>Microsoft has int_128, int_64, etc.</p>
<h1>Three store instructions</h1>
<p><code>sw, sh, and sb</code>.</p>
<p>Each command takes two things: a register and a memory locaiton. Memory locations do not fit in registers.</p>
<h1>Address Modes</h1>
<p>Mathematical formulas that compute a location in memory, aka an effective address, or EA.</p>
<p>High languages have syntax to get parts of an array - assembly has address modes.</p>
<p>High Level Language | Address Mode | Math Formula
---|---
Global Variable | Absolute AM | EA = constant
Pointer | Indirect AM | EA = value of a register.
Array index | Scaled | EA = reg + reg * constant
Structure | Displacement | EA = reg + constant</p>
<p>We cant use Absolute AM in MIPS because we cant put a 32bit thing in the instructions.</p>
<p>Scaled mode can simulate Displacement mode, but it cant work the other way.</p>
