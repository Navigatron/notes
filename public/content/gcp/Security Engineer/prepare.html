<h1>Preparing for Your Professional Cloud Security Engineer Journey</h1>
<p>The exam covers 5 <em>Domains</em> (also called <em>Sections</em>). Each Section includes multiple <em>Objectives</em>.</p>
<p>The Sections and their Objectives are available in a tree-structure in the <a href="./guide.html"><em>Exam Guide</em></a>.</p>
<p>This course will be broken down into <em>Modules</em>.</p>
<p>Modules 1 through 5 map to the 5 domains of the exam.</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Configuring access within a cloud solution environment</li>
<li>Configuring network security</li>
<li>Ensuring data protection</li>
<li>Managing operations in a cloud solution environment</li>
<li>Ensuring compliance</li>
<li>Next steps</li>
</ol>
<h2>Module 00: Introduction</h2>
<h3>Introduction to the role</h3>
<p><em>What is the role of a Professional Cloud Security Engineer (PCSE)?</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Enables organizations to design and implement secure workloads and infrastructure</li>
<li>Designs, Develops, and Manages a secure infrastructure by leveraging google cloud security technologies</li>
</ol>
<p>A PCSE has proficiencies in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity and access management
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Control access to stuff</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Defining organization structure and policies
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Write the rules that control access to stuff</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using GCP tech to provide data protection
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Control access to stuff (data)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Configuring network security defenses
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Configure network stuff to control access to stuff (network-based stuff)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Collecting and analyzing GCP Logs
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Read stuff to see who accessed stuff</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Managing incident responses
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>oh no someone accessed our stuff</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Applying dynamic regulatory considerations
<ul>
<li>&quot;Changing stuff to fit new legal requirements&quot;</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>The government says to control access to stuff</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this course, we will imagine ourselves as an employee of &quot;<strong>Cymbal Bank</strong>&quot;.</p>
<p>Cymbal wants secure operations within a hybrid cloud environment. We will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work w/ cloud architects and network engineers to design the cloud env
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Work w/ people to make a plan</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use security practices that are in compliance with industry regulations
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow the law</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Configure IAM and help define organizational structure and policies
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Configure the access to the stuff</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensure that Cymbal bank makes use of GCP tech
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the right tool for each job</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Exam questions will be scenarios involving Cymbal bank, wherein we must select the <em>best</em> answer.</p>
<h3>Cert Value and Benefits</h3>
<p>Why become certified?</p>
<ul>
<li>Industry recognition</li>
<li>Validates expertise</li>
</ul>
<p>The associate cert requires technical knowledge. The professional cert <em>adds on</em> the ability to evaluate case studies and <em>design</em> solutions - make business-aware decisions.</p>
<p>The following modules follow the exam guide. The exam guide is broken into 5 <em>sections</em>, each of which has multiple <em>objectives</em>. Modules 1 through 5 of this course map to the 5 sections of the exam guide.</p>
<p>Each module corresponding to a <em>section</em> will have <em>diagnostic questions</em>. These questions will help identify knowledge gaps, to guide your studying.</p>
<p>At each point in a module that corresponds to an <em>objective</em>, there will be resources for learning to accomplish that objective.</p>
<h3>Certification Process</h3>
<p>Resources for studying:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online courses. Recommended include:
<ul>
<li>Fundamentals of GCP (number 2 on the path, after this one)</li>
<li>Networking in GCP (3). Two &quot;sub courses&quot;:
<ul>
<li>Defining and implementing networks</li>
<li>Hybrid connectivity and network management</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Security and GCP (4). Three &quot;Sub Courses&quot;:
<ul>
<li>managing security in GCP</li>
<li>security best practices in GCP</li>
<li>Mitigating security vulnerabilities in GCP</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>practice labs</li>
<li>practice questions</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The learning path also includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure Access and Identity in Google Cloud</li>
<li>Logging, Monitoring, and Observability in Google Cloud</li>
<li>Secure Workloads in Google Kubernetes Engine</li>
</ul>
<p>It's interesting that these aren't mentioned here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Skill badges are learning paths made of labs. Do them to get badges. badges=labs and labs=badges.</p>
<p>Sample questions: Diagnostic questions identify knowledge gaps, to show you where to study - sample questions are also good, and simulate the exam.</p>
<p><strong>Exam questions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Present a scenario</li>
<li>Explain the goal; what you are trying to achieve</li>
<li>Ask you what you would do in that situation</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read questions carefully</li>
<li>Anticipate the correct answer</li>
<li>More than one answer may be possible</li>
<li>Take questions at face value</li>
<li>Pay attention to qualifiers (&quot;usually&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, &quot;best&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>[https://cloud.google.com/docs] is your new best friend.</p>
<h3>Creating your study plan</h3>
<p>Diagnostic questions will identify study areas, and resources to reinforce those areas.</p>
<p>Questions will relate to the cymbal bank scenario.</p>
<p>Diagnostic questions don't cover the entire exam.</p>
<p>Sections and Objectives will contain links to additional learning resources.</p>
<h3>Workbook</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The workbook comes in multiple formats. I used the Google Slides version, so I could keep it open and edit in another tab - it's also associated with my google account, so I won't lose it.</p>
<p>It looks like the workbook has all the diagnostic questions in it - I find it helpful to highlight text in each answer and add comments as to why I think that answer is right or wrong.</p>

<h2>Module 01: Configuring Access within a cloud solution environment</h2>
<h3>Module Overview</h3>
<ol>
<li>Planning Cymbal Bank's cloud identity and access management</li>
<li>Diagnostic questions</li>
<li>Review and study planning</li>
</ol>
<h3>Planning Cymbal Bank's Identity and Access Management</h3>
<p>CB is extending data center and office to GCP, following a hybrid model.</p>
<ul>
<li>Config cloud identity</li>
<li>Config service accounts</li>
<li>least-privilege access control</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Google Cloud Directory Sync&quot; (GCDS) will run daily, to sync AD into google cloud identity.</p>
<p>Service accounts provide services access to GCP.</p>
