# Roast

> 2020-01-01, dad's making pork roast

- Tie it with string
- rub with spices
	- Make sure the spice mix doesn't have too much salt
	- 2019-01-01, 'Pork Barrel BBQ all American seasoning rub'
- Sear in a cast iron until... seared.
- Throw the whole situation into a 300deg oven
- You're gonna need a kitchen thermometer
- Cook until center temp is 140 Imperial Units
- take it out, let it rest
- residual radiation will carry it up to 145/165, FDA recommended minimum

> Dad's taken it out of the oven, has it covered on the stove. Good thing we're eating soon.
