## Analysis

1 onion appears standard.

Chili powder has garlic powder in it, but it looks like few recipes use fresh garlic. I am a big fan of garlic - I'll use some.

It looks like equal parts chili powder and cumin is standard (with one exception), with roughly 2Tbsp each.

Sugar and oregano both appear optional. I have both on hand, so I'll use both - replacing white sugar with brown sugar though.

2 pounds of meat appears standard, typically ground beef. I've been looking for an excuse to buy bacon though, so I'll throw some of that in as well.

I will forgo cayenne, as a guest is sensitive to heat. I have hot sauce on hand for the rest of us.

Beans appear optional - I'm a fan, so they're going in.

Some kind of tomato base, with or without stock/broth, appears common. I will likely use beef stock, to complement the ground beef. 1.5 cups should do it. It looks like a 15oz can of tomato-something is the wave, plus some tomato paste? Some recipes also use 8oz of sauce.

I'll add salt and pepper to taste. I don't think lemon juice / vinegar will be necessary, but I'll keep it on hand.

I have smoked paprika on hand, which is fantastic stuff, so I'll likely throw in a tsp of that too.
