# Project part 4

- Multimedia assignment
- 11:59PM, Friday April 19th
- feedback on part 3 by April 10th
- No late submissions, at all.
- create PSA in media of choice
- Include
	- things about the disease
		- symptoms
		- causes
		- treatment
		- etc
	- How does the ecosystem impact the disease
		- Caused or worsened by something in env?
		- Is a specific demographic affected?
- There will be 3 presentation times
	- must attend at least 2 of three
	- one is in class
	- one is out of class
	- one is during final exam time

# Ecology

## Populations Structure and Dynamics

> "Ecologists are those which describe the natural world at its largest scale"

Features of a Population

- Size - number of individuals in an area
	- *There's like, 100 birds here.*
- Density - Measurement of population per unit
	- *There's roughly 50 birds per square mile.*
- Dispersion - The pattern of spacing among individuals within the area
	- *The birds are clustered in groups of 5*

Types of Dispersion

- clumped
	- groups
	- Humans live mostly in cities, with large empty areas between the cities
- uniform
	- evenly spread out
	- like penguins, everyone's got as much breathing room as possible.
- random
	- who knows?

Populations change over time

- increase through immigration and births
- decrease through emigration and deaths

Life tables and Survivorship Curves

Life tables track survivorship, the probability of an individual reaching a certain age.

Survivorship Curves are similar, but in line-graph form.

- Type I - Late Loss
	- Humans tend to live a while, then die off close to max lifespan.
- Type II - Constant Loss
	- Squirrels die off at a constant rate
- Type III - Early Loss
	- Oysters tend to reproduce and die quickly - those that live longer though, live a lot longer.

Exponential Growth

Population increases exponentially until limiting factors are encountered.

- J curve - Growth starts slow, but increases with time
- S curve - starts slow, gets faster, slows down as approaches carrying capacity

Calculating Growth

Growth rate (r) = birth rate - death rate

- r > 0
	- Population increasing
- r = 0
	- Population stagnant, no growth
- r < 0
	- Population is shrinking. US and Japan currently and others.
