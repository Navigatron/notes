- Project part II due MAR1 (~9days)

### The Human Brain

- Limbic system
    - in the middle
    - Thalamus and hypothalamus
        - Emotional response
    - Hippocampus
        - Formation and recall of memories
    - Amygdala
        - records emotional content in memories
    - Thalamus
        - "Sensory switchboard"
        - Sends input to cerebrum
    - Hypothalamus
        - "Integrating center"
        - Nervous and endocrine systems come together
            - convert electrical signals to chemical signals
        - regulates homeostasis (Temp, sleep, food, water)
- Midbrain
    - Small, central part of brainstem
    - Relays info to/from spinal cord
- Hindbrain
    - Cerebellum
        - Integrates input from eyes, ears, joints, muscles
        - maintains balance, spatial awareness
    - Medulla Oblongata
        - Regulates heartbeat, breathing, blood pressure
        - v important
    - Pons
        - Relays between cerebellum and brain stem
        - reflex response, head movement to audio/visual stimuli
    - reticular formation
        - Diffuse network throughout core of brainstem
        - involved in levels of alertness and sleep
- The Spinal Cord
    - From the base of the brain, through the spine
    - goes through the vertebrae

## Chapter 29 - Senses

### Sensory Reception

Special neurons or other cells are tuned to the conditions of the external world.

All sensory receptors trigger an action potential, relaying information to the central nervous system.

Four steps to making a sensation occur:

- Transduction
    - Sensory receptors respond to stimulus by triggering a nerve impulse
- Conduction
    - From the receptor in the sense organ towards the CNS (central nervous system) via the peripheral nervous system.
- Translation
    - "DNA translates impulse into sensation"
    - *My DNA translates nerve impulses into sensations?*
    - *I need to go to office hours and ask for clarification, this is a little sus*
- Perception
    - Conscious awareness

Example: Tasting Sugar

- Sugar enters taste bud
    - Sugar receptor protein detects presence of sugar
    - Triggers the movement of some ions into/out of the cell
    - Change in charge here is "**receptor potential**"
    - Stronger stimulus leads to stronger receptor potential
    - Receptor potential leads to release of neurotransmitters
- And it's neurons all the way back up

**Receptive Field**: The area that will trigger a strong response in a sensory cell.
The size of an RF is measured by a *2-point discrimination test*.

Mouth, Tongue, Fingers have lots of receptors with small RFs. Back has few receptors with large RFs.

Types of receptors

- Thermoreceptors
    - Temperature variation
- Pain receptors (Nociceptors)
    - Detect... danger.
- Mechanoreceptors
    - Touch, pressure, sound, body position
- Chemoreceptors
    - Chemical changes
    - Nose and taste buds
- Electromagnetic receptors
    - Mostly light, in eyes

Senses

- General (somatic) senses
    - Temperature
    - Touch
    - Pain
    - Pressure
    - Body Position
- Special senses
    - Smell
    - Taste
    - Hearing
    - Vision
    - Equilibrium

#### An overview of the human ear

- Pinna
    - "Fleshy Flap" - what we think of as our ear.
    - funnels sound waves into auditory canal
- Auditory canal
    - has wax in it, captures unwanted stuff
- Ear drum
    - Tight membrane ends auditory canal (Tympanic membrane)
    - Vibrates with sound waves, causes vibrations behind it
- Tympanic cavity
    - contains the parts that detect vibration of the tympanic membrane
    - Eustachian tube connects to pharynx for pressure equalization
- Bones
    - malleus (Hammer)
    - incus (Anvil)
    - Stapes (Stirrup)
- Oval window (Behind stapes)
    - allows movement of mechanical energy from stapes into inner ear
- Inner Ear
    - Cochlea
        - Looks like a spiral
        - sound waves move fluid within
        - Fluid movement bends "hairs", which trigger nerve signals
        - Different pitches cause movement in specific areas of the cochlea
    - Semicircular Tubes
        - Detect balance and orientation
