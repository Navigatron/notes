- What can normal employees do during recovery?
	- Everyone has a role.
- How many roles can a person fill?
	- If the roles aren't all at the same time, a lot.

	- They'll have a crisis center to talk to
- Crisis management and physical crisis?
	- You wouldn't need an e-ops site for a network outage
- work area vs e-ops
	- work area is getting a work area setup for all
	- e-ops is for management only
- Where does the containment team come from?
	- They're probably also in facilities

	- I would call this a 'golden parachute' scenario.
- difference in terms
	- Crisis - we don't know what's going on, or it's a major immediate thing.
		- Must be addressed before work can continue
	- Incident - something you can work around, doesn't stop everything
		- network attack is an incident, building on fire is crisis
	- Event - something happened, joe spilled his coffee. Situation.
	- Disaster - Crisis stage 2.

> crisis -> emergency response -> disaster
