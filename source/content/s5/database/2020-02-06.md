> Looks like I missed something important last class

## Catchup

> This section is for the info I find in myCourses about last class

- HW3 is due on the 11th at 11:59PM
- New Data Types
	- SMALLINT
		- an int is 4 bytes but a smallint is only 2
	- DECIMAL
		- two arguments: precision and scale
		- precision: how many digits. 999.99 has 5.
		- scale: How many of the digits are to the right of the decimal
	- Things can be UNSIGNED
- New Constraints
	- `NOT NULL`
		- it cannot be null
		- Attribute level
	- `CHECK`
		- keeps the value of a column compliant with an expression
		- Attribute level: `Age int CHECK >= 18` (I think)
		- Table level: `CONSTRAINT table_chk CHECK (Age>=18)`
		- Literally ignored by MySQL
	- `DEFAULT`
		- what is it by default?
		- `Name varchar(255) DEFAULT 'Greg',`
	- Atomic vs Relative data integrity checks
		- Atomic
			- looks at proposed value for attribute before insertion
			- `NOT NULL`
		- Relative
			- Looks at proposed field value compared to other data
			- `UNIQUE`
	- Naming
		- What?
	- Table versus Attribute Level
		- What?
- DML
	- SELECT
		- Relational Operators (>, >=, LIKE *string*, IN (*list*), etc)
		- LIKE operators:
			- `_` matches any single char
			- `%` matches 0 or more chars
			- `WHERE thing LIKE '%.exe'` matches exe files
		- `WHERE attribute BETWEEN low AND high`
		- `WHERE attribute = value OR attribute = otherValue`
		- Calculations
			- `SELECT `
	- UPDATE
	- DELETE
		- Will delete everything
		- WHERE clauses are mandatory here
- DDL
	- ALTER
	- The Help System

## HW2 review

- Converting from an ER diagram to a Relation
	- Colors should be included in the Relation, even though there's no way to store it (it's multi-valued)
