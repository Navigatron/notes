## Transactions

Either the whole transaction works, or fails.

Moving money between bank accounts - withdraw from one, deposit in the other. Either execute both or neither, never just one.

Transaction Control Language (TCL)

- COMMIT - save these changes
- ROLLBACK - abandon these changes

## ACID

Properties of a transaction

- Atomic
	- greek for 'indivisible'
	- All or nothing
- Consistency
	- Must not break integrity constraints (fks)
- Isolation
	- Concurrent transactions do not impact each other.
	- involves locking rows, executing txs 1 at a time
- Durability
	- If it happens, it happens.

## How to

Individual statements are treated as transactions by default. This can be disabled with:

```sql
SET AUTOCOMMIT=0;
```

Here's a transaction example:

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Savings SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE Account = 'example1';
UPDATE Checking SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE Account = 'example2';
COMMIT;
```

## On-Delete and On-Update

```sql
ADD CONSTRAINT name_fk FOREIGN KEY (keyname) REFERENCES table(keyname) ON DELETE action ON UPDATE action;
```

Action can be:

- CASCADE
- SET NULL
- SET DEFAULT
- NO ACTION
