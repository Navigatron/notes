Today we get to jump into SQL

## Step 4 - Creating a relational schema in a DBMS

- Data Definition Language (DDL)
	- Deals primarily with Metadata
	- Create DBs, Tables, Changing structure
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
	- Deals primarily with User Data
	- INSERT, SELECT

Each manufacturer of a DBMS adds a few special features to differentiate their product. This can cause problems.

We will be using MySQL, which was open source and was then eaten by oracle.

> There's a fork called MariaDB, it's a drop-in, open-source substitute.

## metadata commands

Create a database

`CREATE DATABASE databasename`

Remove a database

`DROP DATABASE databasename`

Show databases with `SHOW`

Comments work like this:

```sql
-- Single line comments
-- hyphen hyphen space

/*
Multi-line comments are like Java
*/
```

## Use

'Open' a database with `USE databasename`

## Creating Tables

```
CREATE TABLE tablename (
	attributeName datatype,
	attributeName datatype,
	CONSTRAINT constraint_name PRIMARY KEY (attributeName)
);
```

### Datatypes

> TODO - insert link here to datatypes

`DESCRIBE tablename` will show the metadata about a table
