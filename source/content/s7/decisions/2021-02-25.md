## Value of a Statistical Life (VSL)

How much are you willing to pay to prevent an accidental death?

We make these decisions all the time:

- Do you drive something other than a volvo?
    - If not, it implies the added cost of a volvo is greater than the risk reduction over the lifetime of the car
- Do you drive instead of fly to save money?
    - This implies the cost difference between driving and flying is greater than the reduced risk of flying

Should we use a lower VSL for old people?

> Class consensus is leaning towards yes

> Prof. notes that VSL increases over time, and it increases faster than inflation. People can do more as time goes on.

A scenario: 1000 people each get a 1 in 1000 chance of dying. This is more acceptable than 1 person getting a 1 in 1 chance of dying.

> RISK DENSITY. What!? This is wild!
