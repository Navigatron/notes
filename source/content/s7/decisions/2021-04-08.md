Multiple Linear Regression

You can have more than one input variable. This raises a tough question - what should be in the model, and what shouldn't be? Remember, the R^2 value will *always* go up with more data.

The coefficient intervals for a predictor might not even overlap between regressions of different sets of inputs.

P>|t| - lower means more significant
