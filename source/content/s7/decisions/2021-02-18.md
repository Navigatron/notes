Assignment 1 is graded! General feedback:

- Use multiple sources for a number
- significant figures are important
    - Are you sure about your answer to 7 significant figures?
    - Could someone dispute the last digit?
    - Is that a claim you are comfortable making?
    - If 1.53 isn't different from 1.54, but is different from 1.6, then maybe it should be 1.5
- citations are important
- Figures and Tables should have captions
- Always label axes on graphs
- Case study report structure:
    - Intro
    - Methods
    - Results
    - Discussion
