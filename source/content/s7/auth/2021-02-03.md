# 2021-02-03: Lab 1

> Arrived to class late. Groups are claiming topics. Multiple groups have chosen biometrics, and must go through some de-conflicting.

Who should you ask for help?

- For writing projects: Prof.
- For labs: The TA's.

There will be a new zoom link next week, that auto-provisions breakout rooms - look out for that.

> Class breaks into breakout rooms and works on Lab 1

You need two images to use as keyfiles. I used these:

- Key1: [A dog with puppies](https://external-preview.redd.it/YfyiafXoKHhdchHkElXj-Nzn7h3Ec2Bv44X4UVB4WOI.jpg?s=606e0f65a2bef6094648728dde648067b3c08918)
- Key2: [A different dog](https://i.redd.it/ub8seni97dj51.jpg)

By downloading the keyfiles, you don't need to host them or worry about the hosting provider changing them on upload.
