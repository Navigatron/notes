In a quantum computer, bits are not in one of two states - their state is unknown, and resolves to on/off with some probability.

Classical States - on / off.

Quantum states are a vector from the center to the surface of a sphere. Straight up is 0, and straight down is 1. When the vector points to the equator, it has a 50/50 chance of resolving to 1 or zero.

When the vector points halfway between the equator and the north pole, it is more likely to resolve to 1, but could still go to zero. (My trig isn't great rn so I can't name the exact percentages, just know it's not 75%)

## Dirac Notation

We represent quantum units in the complex plain, as $a+bi$.

We say up is $|0>$ and down is $|1>$

Superposition psi is amplitudes mapped to directions (kets).
