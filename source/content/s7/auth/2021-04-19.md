Complexity theory: P does not equal NP. I have no idea what this means.

NP-complete and NP-hard mean a problem is hard. Apparently they are so hard that quantum computers might not make them easy.

## Lattice-Based Crypto

A lattice is an infinite grid. From here, prof went on about "dimensionality", and never talked about how it works.

## Ring Learning With Errors key Exchange

?

## Multivariate Cryptography

Something something multivariate polynomials.

> "It has a short signature, which is useful"

The above block quote is meaningless without further explanation. Thanks prof.

We can hide quadratic equations in oil and vinegar, but the oil and vinegar have to be unbalanced.

## Hash-based cryptography

Merkle trees are cool - it's a hash of hashes. So far, this is the only part of today's lecture that makes sense.

## McEliece Cryptosystem

Uses large matrices as keys, uses randomization, faster than RSA, never saw wide adoption.
