One time pads are provably secure. Lamport's One-Time Passwords are similar.

Each time the password is used, both parties hash it to generate the next password.

Physical Tokens are password generation machines - they have some formula to incrementally create a password, typically involving time.

Yubikey uses:

- unique secret ID (6 bytes)
- Session Counter (2 bytes)
- Timestamp (3 bytes)
- Session Token Counter (1 byte)
- Pseudo Random Value (2 bytes)
- CRC Checksum (2 bytes)
