## Administrative

MyCourses has been *updated?* What could this mean? Are there duedates now?

In previous semesters there was a biometrics / ml lab, that is now available for "funsies".

## Parts of access control

- Authentication
    - What identity do you claim to be?
    - What evidence supports your claim?
- Authorization
    - What privileges do you have?

For authentication - what evidence could be used? Something you:

- have
    - yubikey
    - duo mfa
- know
    - passwords
- are
    - fingerprints
    - facial recognition
    - gait recognition
    - voice recognition
    - handwritten signature
    - odor recognition
        - change your deodorant? There goes the hard drive.

## Passwords

- Store passwords in a file.
    - But an attacker with the file has the passwords
- Hash the Passwords
    - But a rainbow table will crack many at once
- Hash with a salt
    - But multiple could be cracked in one run
- Use a different salt each time

But users still re-use passwords.
