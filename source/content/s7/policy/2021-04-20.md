The end of the semester approaches with shocking speed. I am not ready.

Last week's discussion post was the last one.

Only 7 students can present on the last day. Students who willingly present earlier will receive bonus points. A google sheet will be coming out soon, to sign-up for presentation sessions.

The Thursday and Friday sessions are optional if you aren't attending. They will be recorded.

The final paper is due on May 10th. This is after the presentations.
