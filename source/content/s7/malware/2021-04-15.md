The `C` key is the "Make as Code" hotkey. If you load a binary file, it can be used to convert what is displayed to assembly.

A NOP sled is a technique to get execution to a certain point. As long as execution lands somewhere on the sled, it will fall forwards to the goal. Since NOP sleds are recognizable, it might be a different repetition of opcodes.

Olly - Use Olly110, not 201, since 201 is very buggy. Olly is one of the few things that can handle 32-bit instructions. F7 will advance the simulation one step, and F2 can set a breakpoint.

> We saw a demo in which shellcode was loaded in Ollydbg, and decrypted in real-time before our very eyes. That might be the coolest demo I've seen in a class.

Don't create breakpoints in decrypted ciphertext - it writes `CC`, aka a breakpoint, to that location - and then it won't decrypt right.

For Lab 9, the instructions say to use x32dbg. Do not use x32dbg, it has bugs and problems. Use Ollydbg.

Helpful keyboard shortcuts:

- `F2` - Set Breakpoint
- `F7` - step into a call
- `F8` - step over a call
- `F9` - run
