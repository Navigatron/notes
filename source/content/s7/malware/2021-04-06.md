The Final Project! Part 1:

- Use C or C++
- Client / Server
- Client extracts information:
    - ip address
    - mac address
    - username
    - operating system
    - running processes
- Information must be encoded

Part 2:

- Reverse Engineer our own client
- Annotate the encoding subroutine
    - Give it a name
    - Name all the variables
- Use IDA to explain how it works
- Show how compiler settings affect the output

Groups of 2 or 3. Also there's a presentation and live demo.

Due on day 1 of week 14 (April 26th).
