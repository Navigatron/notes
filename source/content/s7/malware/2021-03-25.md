- Registers typically have pointers to objects
    - ESI and ECX are usually used for this
- Objects may have a pre-defined size
- Elements in the object have pre-defined offsets
- Offsets can store different things
    - DWORD, Byte, Char, Handle...
    - Pointer to a function
    - Pointer to *another* function

## IDA Magic

We can:

- Create custom definitions, to:
    - Identify the presence of objects
    - Define custom offsets
    - Derive variable types
    - Derive variable purposes
    - Derive the overall meaning of a structure
- Use Pre-compiled header definitions
    - Window uses a bunch of structures
    - These can be auto-recognized

## Create a struct in IDA

In the structs tab, hit insert. You have a struct now!

The struct is automatically created with field_0, which can be re-named with `N`.

`D` does something important. Right-click, "Field Type" is also important.
