There is a midterm:

- oh dear oh no
- In about 2 weeks
- time given: roughly 1 week

## Basic network countermeasures

Firewalls, IDS, and IPS can test for:

- IP address
- TCP/UDP Port number
- domain names
- traffic content
    - "Deep Packet Inspection"

Firewalls and network equipment can block IPs and ports.

DNS servers can *sinkhole* a domain to an internal host.

Proxy servers can detect and block domains.

- IDS
    - Intrusion Detection System
    - Receives a *copy* of network traffic
    - Blocks traffic by alerting something else
- IPS
    - Intrusion Prevention System
    - Sits inline with the traffic
    - Self-updates to block threats

## Use your information

Before:

- detonating the malware to see what happens
- firing up the code disassembler

You should:

- See if someone's already analyzed it
    - upload a hash somewhere
    - Out of scope for this class, don't upload homework lol
- Analyze existing artifacts

Malware can be built to detect lab environments. The best environment is completely open, where the malware can be observed without *knowing* it is being observed. Seeing the malware talking to its C2 server provides lots of valuable info.

## Example

A malware sample is detonated. It:

- requests badsite.com via DNS
- sends an HTTP Get to badsite.com
- waits 30 seconds
- beacon to a specific IP
