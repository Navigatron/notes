Custom encoding is nice:

- very small size
- not obvious
- "key" is the unencoding code itself
- Reverse-engineering resistant

## Self-Decoding

Self-decoding is where you let the malware run somewhat, to do the decoding itself. You don't have to build a decoder, just set a breakpoint after the decoding function and check memory for strings after it's reached.

The malware might not decode everything you're looking for though. Building your own decoder is a good idea.

## Instrumentation

If the encoding / decoding functions can be identified, then a wrapper can be made that passes "ciphertext" to those specific functions. The *malware itself* can be used as a tool.
