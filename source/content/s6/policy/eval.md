# Policy Evaluation

1. Identify Goals
	- *Has the policy achieved its goals?*
1. Understand how a policy works
	- We want to understand why a policy leads to the results that it does
1. Identify targeting population
	- Who is the policy intended to affect? Who does it affect?
1. Measure the outcome
	- "Devise a means to measure the extend to which the goals have been achieved"
	- Often involves *Counterfactuals* - What would have happened?
	- This is very very difficult.
1. Decide on the criteria/value system
	- On what grounds will we evaluate the policy?

## Example: Fema + HMGP

Fema's goal is to reduce losses from natural hazards.

The *Hazard Mitigation Grant Program* gives funds to state and local govs, after a disaster, to help mitigate future disasters. The HMGP could fund up to 75% of mitigation projects.

*How can we evaluate the HMGP?*

> This can relate to business - how can a business measure the success of an internal program? Do pizza parties actually help morale?

1. Goals - to reduce the losses from natural disasters.
2. Method - localities voluntarily propose projects for funding
	- Projects are area specific, no dams in the desert! Nice.
	- Voluntary participation means it might not be as effective as hoped.
3. Target Population - Areas where disasters can strike
4. Measuring the Outcomes
	- Projected losses from a disaster - actual losses = losses avoided. How to determine this?
	- Idea - Look at the decrease in insurance rates in the area?
