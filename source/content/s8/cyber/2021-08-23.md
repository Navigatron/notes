> "Security is a Feeling"

> SETA - Security Education, Training, and Awareness

Information is in one of three states:

- Data in Motion
- Data at Rest
- Data in Use

These are called the "Avenues of Access"

Identify, prevent, Detect, Response, Recover (this is not picerl)

The three pillars or risk:

- Information Technology
- Operational
- Fraud and Financial Crime

IT is where cyber attacks hit.

Risk appetite: What can we accept? What isn't worth worrying about?

Identify, Prevent, Detect, Respond

- Identify potential threats
- Prevent those things from happening
- Detect those events
- Respond to them, recover

Stumbling Blocks:

- Organizational Silos
    - cyber doesn't stay in its bucket
- Insufficient Business Involvement
    - Cyber risk is a business problem, not just a technical one.
- Over-reliance on training and communications
    - Controlling risk *only* by changing human behavior
- Talent shortfalls
    - self explanatory
