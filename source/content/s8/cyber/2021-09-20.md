The project - prof is working on it.

"Think like a pirate." Pirates sail the seven seas, stealing from established places. Hackers act similarly.

Phrases:

- Be aware of your surroundings.
- Keep your friends close, enemies closer
- Only offense is good defense
- Only defense is active defense

Read Sun Tzu's art of war.

- All warfare is based on deception
    - When near, appear far
    - When far, appear near
    - When attacking, seem unable to attack
- Know your enemies, know yourself

The military gives SALUTE reports:

- size
- activity
- location
- uniform
- time
- events

You cannot defend against that which you cannot detect

- Vulnerabilities
    - A weakness
- Threats
    - A source or means of attack
- Risk
    - "The combination of the probability of an event and its consequence"
    - Probability x Impact

## Risk management

The critical question:

> What control is the most cost-effective at reducing risk?

If I can mitigate $100 of risk with $10, that's awesome. If it costs $90, it's still worthwhile. If the best option costs $150, don't do it!
