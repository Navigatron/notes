<!--
Accellion - responsibility to disclose
-->

Identification - someone or something is claiming an identity.

Authentication - is the claim true? Prove it!

> Measure features of the supplicant and compare them to the stored model of the identity being claimed

How do we measure authentication? By measuring:

- Things we know (passwords)
- Things we have (phone MFA)
- Things we are (biometrics)
- Things we do
	- Gait and typing recognition
- Where we are
