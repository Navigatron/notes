The four major goals:

- Equity
- Efficiency
- Security
- Liberty

> If there is a test, that list will certainly be on it.

## Equity

There are lots of ways to distribute resources. Some ways are more "equitable" than others. Equity is *not* Equality.

Equity can deal with civil rights in addition to resources.

## Efficiency

Policy can optimize for efficiency.

## Security

> "Security means the satisfaction of minimum human needs"
> no it doesnt?

Providing for the public welfare:

- Homeless shelters
- Subsidized public housing
- food stamps
- social security
- "Minimum wage laws" *this is disputed*
- National Defense

Energy grid resiliency and cybersecurity might also fall here.

## Liberty

> "People are free unless their actions cause some sort of harm to others"

The first amendment is a fantastic example of a policy designed to protect liberty.

Liberty is often in conflict with the other goals.

<!-- Please identify a public policy of your interest, briefly describe what it is, and explain what specific goals (for example, equity, efficiency, security, liberty) it promotes. Also, does the same policy potentially compromise/sacrifice other goals in the meantime? -->
