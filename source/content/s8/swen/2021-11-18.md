The project is now in sprint 4.

MVP should be done. If you would like to put more into it, talk to Prof.

Sprint 4 is mostly about documentation, like:

- state charts
- sequence diagrams
- code coverage

Think of this sprint as a full release - you are handing off the project, entirely, to the "next team".

## Professional Responsibility

There are ethical considerations to everything we do.

- Do right by your clients and employer
- Do right by your team and yourself
- Do right by your responsibilities to society

> Don't build tools that help debt collectors harass people

Make your actions count and do them so that you can be proud of the actions you have done.

- Care about your craft
- Think about your work
- Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio
- Put your name on it!

Be:

- respectful
- responsible
- self-aware
