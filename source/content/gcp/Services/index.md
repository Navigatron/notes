Here's a list of the GCP services (and features) I've heard about:

- Load Balancing
	- "HTTPS"
		- Expose via a single IP, globally
		- TLS terminating reverse proxy, optimized for HTTPS
	- "SSL Proxy"
		- A TLS Terminating reverse proxy
		- Intended for **Non**-HTTPS traffic
	- "TCP Proxy"
		- it's a tcp reverse proxy
- CloudArmor
	- WAF
- Cloud DNS
	- A DNS service that loves DNSSEC
	- "Public Zone"
		- A DNS zone exposed to the internet
	- "Private Zone"
		- A DNS zone exposed to a VPC
	- "Peering Zone"
		- The Cloud DNS provider in VPC-A can be configged to send certain requests to the instance in VPC-B. No communication between VPCs required, it's handled behind the scenes by the Cloud DNS backbone.
	- "Forwarding Zone"
		- Similar to Peering, requests hit GCP DNS and are *forwarded* to some other IP, like an external/public DNS server. Can be configged to only forward certain requests.
- Identity-Aware Proxy
	- **Further research required**
- Identity Platform
	- It's an identity provider, where users sign in and stuff
- Directory Sync
	- A tool that syncs on-prem AD with the Identity Platform
- IAM Conditions
	- Rules that control when/where perms/roles can be used
- Google Key Management
	- "GKE Workload Identity"
		- Sounds like system-assigned managed identity from azure?
		- Like a service account?
	- "Workload Identity Federation"
		- **Not sure what this is**
- "Firewall Rules"
	- yeah
- VPC: Virtual Private Cloud Network
	- "Shared VPC"
		- What is this?
		- It's like a big VPC that you put *projects* in. There's a host project that owns the shared vpc.
	- "VPC Peering"
		- Allows VPCs to talk to each other
	- "VPC Service Controls"
		- like IAM conditions, but for data transiting a VPC
- Cloud VPN
	- Endpoints communicate via IPSEC
	- an on-prem gateway and a VPC gateway makes a hybrid network
	- Multiple gateways in the cloud could also connect to each other
- Interconnect
	- low-latency, highly-available connection from on-prem to gcp. Two flavors.
	- "Dedicated Interconnect"
		- Direct physical connection, with wires and shovels
		- 10GBps
	- "Partner Interconnect"
		- The ISP / 3rd party lets you use their high-speed line
- Google Private Access
	- Allows requests to GCP APIs from private networks
	- **What? How??**
	- VPC peering connects your VPC to one that has google stuff
	- "Private Service Connect for Google APIS"
		- Goes in a VPC, forwards requests to google's APIs.
- Cloud NAT
	- It's a NAT gateway for VPCs.
- BigQuery
	- A database?
- CloudStorage
	- blob storage
- ComputeEngine
	- VMs
- CloudRouter
	- **??**
- googleapis.com
	- private.googleapis.com
		- **??**
	- restricted.googleapis.com
		- **??**
- Cloud DLP
	- Scans data (including images and PDFs via OCR) for *patterns*
	- Extensive library of patterns built-in, custom ones can be added
	- On pattern recognition, can *classify* or *transform*
- Access Control
	- Can filter on DLP Classification
- Secret Manager
	- Stores key-value secrets
	- Changes in secrets can trigger notifications
