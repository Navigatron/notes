# Video - Watch the US stall on climate change for 12 years

- Climate change used to be a bi-partisan issue, everyone was on board
- This is no longer the case

# PowerPoint - "The Best Solution to Global Warming" - Citizen's Climate Lobby

Citizen's Climate Lobby believes the gov can and should work.

At the point of extraction, where the fuel enters the economy, charge a
$100 fee per ton of Carbon. This charges coal more than oil, and oil more than gas.

Fee, not a tax - "Taxes are evil", taxes create programs. Fee goes directly
back into US households.

Meanwhile, oil prices go up. This is fine, households have extra cash to compensate.

Meanwhile, renewable energy gets cheaper.

Houses will likely be more incentivized to purchase renewable energy.

Cost of inaction, cost of catastrophe, will continue to rise. By taking action
the cost of catastrophe can be kept lower - implementing this policy is fiscally responsible.

## Imports

imported things from other countries would pay a tariff at the border

## Track Record
British Columbia, province in Canada, implemented similar law. Very successful.

## Economic impact
CCL paid REMI to analyze impact of proposal
- create many jobs.
- Carbon emissions way down
- Household dividend to reach $350/month in 2025? (had we started in 2015)
