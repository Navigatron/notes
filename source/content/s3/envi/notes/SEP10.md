# End of the Line day 2

## Problems
- we're running out of fish

## Solutions
- Fish farms are not a solution
	- They take more fish than they produce
- Seasons
	- Alaska does this, it's pretty great

There's an alternative style fish-farm in france or spain

[Ted Talk - Fell in love with a fish](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_barber_how_i_fell_in_love_with_a_fish/transcript)

Short excerpt:

> OK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish, a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators. And then I realized when he says, "A farm that has no impurities," he made a big understatement, because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River. It's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days: chemical contaminants, pesticide runoff. And when it works its way through the system and leaves, the water is cleaner than when it entered. The system is so healthy, it purifies the water. So, not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals, not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators, but a farm that's literally a water purification plant -- and not just for those fish, but for you and me as well. Because when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic. A drop in the ocean, I know, but I'll take it, and so should you, because this love story, however romantic, is also instructive. You might say it's a recipe for the future of good food, whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle.
