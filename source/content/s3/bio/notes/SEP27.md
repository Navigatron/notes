- Second Exam in two weeks.

# Enzyme Inhibition

## Competitive inhibition

Something competes with the substrate
- binds to the enzyme
- doesn't break apart.

## Non-Competitive Inhibition

Something doesn't compete with the substrate, binds to
somewhere other than the active site.

## pathways

A series of enzymes that rely on each other, like a supply chain or factory.

The supply line can be stopped at any point depending on which item we need.

1. Enzyme A combines two things
2. Enzyme B breaks off a small piece
3. Enzyme C bends the large piece

## Things that make enzymes happy/unhappy

- "Cofactors"
	- Iron
	- Copper
	- Zinc
- CoEnzymes
	- vitamins, ATP
- Prosthetic groups
	- ????
	- "permanently bound"

# Chapter 6 - Cellular Respiration

The rest of this page has almost zero hard information. This is more background
stuff

## ELI5:

- We harvest energy from food
- we turn this into *buckets* of ATP
- ATP powers just about everything.

## The Goal:

Use energy to mash another phosphate onto ADP. We can break this off later to release some energy.

## When!

2 atp start the process

each glucose molecule converts to roughly 32 atp

## Finally, the formula.

Glucose + 6 oxygen -> 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + ATP + Heat

1 Calorie (Capital C, kilo-calorie) raises 1kg of water by 1 degree Celsius.

When glucose's carbon-hydrogen bonds are broken, electrons are transfered to Oxygen.

The goal is to get the electrons to the mitochondria.

Loosing an electron is *oxidation*

Gaining an electron is *reduction*, because charge becomes more negative.

If some oxygen is reduced, it's charge is more negative, it attracts a hydrogen, it might become water.

Glucose, upon oxidation, becomes carbon dioxide. Oxygen, when reduced, becomes water.

C6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP + Heat

## Enzymes to do things

Start with organic fuel. Dehydrogenase rips some Hydrogen off, yo.
The hydrogen is separated into H+s and Electrons. NAD takes the electrons somewhere else.

Where is somewhere else? It's the Electron transport chain (ETC)! It's a series of enzymes
across the inner membrane of the mitochondria.

At the end of the ETC, the last enzyme gives the electron to Oxygen, which becomes water.

If there's no oxygen, the ETC stops.

## Stages overview

1. Glycolysis
	- Breaking glucose down into...?
	- Takes 2 ATP to start
	- Creates 4 ATP
2. Pyruvate Oxidation is a thing
	- Taking electrons from pyruvate
3. Citric Acid Cycle
	- ??
4. Oxidative Phosphorilation
	- Adding phosphate to ADP
	- This is where we make *buckets*
