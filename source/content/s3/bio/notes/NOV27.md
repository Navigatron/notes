# Plants

Starting plants depend on water to reproduce - they release swimming sperm or spores, they're short, they have no roots. J-chillin on the ground.

Next, they go up

Seedless vascular plants:
- Are taller!
- Are still dependent on water to reproduce

Seeds show up:
- Seeds move around, move the plants around.
- Plants no longer have to be around water
- pine trees, firs, spruces, heckin' dominant for hella time.

Flowers:
- gymnosperms reproduce via random pollen going everywhere
- Flowers attract pollinators!
- But general pollinators move pollen all over the place

Through the magic of co-evolution, specific pollinators evolve

Fruit:
- Animals eat it, go miles away, deposit. Very good plant transport.

# Animals

What is an animal?
- Gotta be multicellular
- Exhibit embryonic development
- Heterotrophic, ingestive. (Eats other things)
	- most digest internally
- No cell walls
