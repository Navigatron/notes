> Let's build an Earth

Early planet earth had an atmosphere with a lot of nasty things

4.5 billion years ago, earth formed.

3.5 billion years ago, some photosynthetic bacteria started doing their thing.

About 2.5 billion years ago, enough oxygen built up that we can call it Atmospheric Oxygen.

Atmospheric oxygen reacts with UV to form ozone above the arctic, which blocks UV. Very good, lets us build more things.

Some eukaryotes started working together.

## radiometric dating

Carbon14's half life is too short to date things from a very very long time ago.

Potasium is much better.
