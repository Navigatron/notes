# Biology 101 Lecture, november 8th

- Genetic Drift
	- bottleneck
		- Loose half the population due to catastrophic event
	- Founder effect
		- colonizing mars

In decreasing the gene pool, some alleles may go extinct.

- Nonrandom mating
	- Some individuals reproduce more often than others
	- intersexual competition - one gender is "choosy"
	- intrasexual competition - competition to mate, such as deer fighting each other.

and then, natural selection

promotes survival and reproductive success in a specific environment

Zebras are black and white - and lions are colorblind.

Three modes of natural selection

- Stabilizing selection - distribution becomes narrower
- Directional selection - push the distribution to one direction
- Disruptive selection - remove the center, push to two different extremes

## Chapter 14 - Macroevolution

- What is a species?
	- a collection that can interbreed to produce fertile offspring, roughly.

When there's a barrier, dividing a population, speciation may occur.

Sympatric speciation - fruit flies that hatch later feed on a different type of apple tree, and breed with each other.

polyploidy - different plants breed to create new plants - most of these are not fertile due to mismatched chromosomes - an error in meiosis that makes each have the same number however can create a new sustainable species.

The below is different from common ancestor traits, like the 1-2-5 bone structure in the arms of many animals.

Analogous Structures - convergent evolution - multiple species evolve towards a similar shape. (Sharks and penguins are both torpedo shape)

Cladistics - how many traits do two species have in common - A clade is a group of similar species
