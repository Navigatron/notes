# Genetics

Natural Selection tries to make a species more fit for survival.

There was a monk named Mendel that did a lot of stuff with pea plants.

Phenotype - White or purple flowers on the pea plant?

Genotype - what the genes say

Dominant gene - If one is present, it takes control.

Recessive gene - If both things are this, you get the recessive trait.

True-Breeding plants can cross with themselves to create identical offspring - every time. This means homozygous.
