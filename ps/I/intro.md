# Groundwork and Discrete Probability

## Set Theory

A capital letter denotes a set. Sets are collections of... stuff.
- Numbers
- Strings
- Shoe Sizes
- Shoes
- Whatever, physical or symbolic.

Below, the set $$A$$ contains some numbers.

$$A = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25}$$

There are some symbols involved for operations.

 Symbolic | Meaning | Explanation
 --- | --- | ---
 $$X \in A$$ | Element Of | X is a thing in set A
 $$A \subset B$$ | Subset | A is a subset of B. If it's in A, it must be in B.
 $$A \cup B$$ | Union | Set of all things in A or B. Give me Both.
 $$A \cap B$$ | Intersection | Set of things in both A and B. The Overlap part of the Venn-Diagram
