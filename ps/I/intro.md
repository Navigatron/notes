# Groundwork and Discrete Probability

## Set Theory

A capital letter denotes a set. Sets are collections of... stuff.
- Numbers
- Strings
- Shoe Sizes
- Shoes
- Whatever, physical or symbolic.

Below, the set $$A$$ contains some numbers.

$$A = \{5, 10, 15, 20, 2}$$

There are some symbols involved for operations.

 Symbolic | Meaning | Explanation
 --- | --- | ---
 $$X \in A$$ | Element Of | X is a thing in set A
 $$A \subset B$$ | Subset | A is a subset of B. If it's in A, it must be in B.
 $$A \cup B$$ | Union | Set of all things in A or B. Give me Both.
 $$A \cap B$$ | Intersection | Set of things in both A and B. The Overlap part of the Venn-Diagram

### Probability

Sets contain possible outcomes. In flipping a coin, there are two possible outcomes: Heads, and Tails.

$$ Flip = \{Heads, Tails\}$$

Sets in probability are *Evaluated*. When the experiment is performed, we get a result. The Probability that Set F (for flip) evaluates to Heads is as follows:

$$P(F = Heads)$$

The set of ping-pong balls in the lottery machine contains the numbers 1 to 30. You've bet on 7.

$$P(L = 7) = \frac 1 30$$

## Axioms of Probability

1. The Probability of an Event is Greater than or Equal to Zero.

$$P(A) \geq 1$$

2. The Probability of Everything is 1.

$$P(\varepsilon) = 1$$

3. The probability of something in a group occurring, is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each thing.

$$P()\cup_{k}A_{k}) = \SigmaP(A_{k})$$

*The last one is a little confusing.*
